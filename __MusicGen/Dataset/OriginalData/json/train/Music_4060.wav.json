The in-game sounds are weird high pitched grunts, female grunts, swoosh sound effects, hitting sound effects and laser sound effects. The background music consists of wide strings melody, woodwinds melody and low staccato brass melody. It sounds suspenseful, intense, dramatic and there is a constant noise in the background."
