    "caption": "This song contains an acoustic drum set playing a fast groove along with a bassline. A e-guitar is playing a distorted solo melody while a male voice gets backed by harmony singers before singing on alone to duck-like sounds. In the background you can hear a lot of duck-like sounds and a hammering that does not belong to the musical composition. This song may be playing as an intro for a kids TV-show."
