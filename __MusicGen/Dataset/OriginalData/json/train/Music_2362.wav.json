    "caption": "The Rock song features a passionate male vocal, layered with harmonizing background male vocals, singing over electric rhythm guitar chords spread widely in the stereo image, thin snare, energetic crash, groovy bass, shimmering hi hats and punchy kick hits. The drums are very reverberant, which is probably the reason why they sound softer. It sounds addictive, thanks to those harmonizing vocals, and energetic overall."
