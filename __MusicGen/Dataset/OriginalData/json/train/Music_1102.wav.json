    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live opera performance sung by passionate female vocalists and followed by sustained and plucked strings melody. The recording is very noisy and the stereo image is unbalanced, since the audio from the left channel is occasionally cut out. It sounds emotional, mellow and passionate."
