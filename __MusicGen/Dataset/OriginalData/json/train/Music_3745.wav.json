    "caption": "This is a classical music piece performed on a baritone saxophone. The tone of the baritone saxophone resembles a cello sound. There is a tender feel to the melody being played. The atmosphere is heart-touching. This piece would fit perfectly in the soundtrack of a documentary with serene scenes such as a birdlife documentary."
