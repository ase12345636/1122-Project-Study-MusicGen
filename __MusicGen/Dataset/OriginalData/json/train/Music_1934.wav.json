    "caption": "The low quality recording features a northern soul song that consists of flat male vocals, alongside melodic male background vocals, singing over funky guitar chords, groovy piano chords, groovy bass, \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern and shimmering open hats. It is noisy and in mono and therefore vintage, but it also sounds warm, nostalgic and sentimental."
