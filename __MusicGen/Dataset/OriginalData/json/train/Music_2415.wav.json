    "caption": "This indie rock song features a piano playing the main melody. This is accompanied by percussion playing a simple beat. It seems like the hi-hat is substituted by the tambourine. A distortion guitar plays power chords. The bass follows the root notes of the chords. There are no voices in this song. The song is upbeat and the mood is happy. This song can be used in the end credits of a romantic movie."
