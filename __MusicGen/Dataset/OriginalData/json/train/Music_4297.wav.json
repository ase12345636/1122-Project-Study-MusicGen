    "caption": "This is a chaotic mix of sound effects meant to scare the listener. There is a carousel-like tune coming from what sounds like a circus setting. Various ominous sound effects such as screaming, roaring and evil laughter can be heard in the piece. There is an ear-piercingly loud synth sound at some point. The atmosphere is creepy. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a horror video game during a nightmare/pandemonium sequence."
