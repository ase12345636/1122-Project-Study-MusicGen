    "caption": "The low quality recording features a hip hop track that consists of flat male vocal rapping over smooth bass, high pitched female vocal, mellow piano melody, shimmering tambourine layered with punchy snare, followed by soft kick and crash cymbal hits. It sounds groovy and emotional, even though the recording is muffled and kind of dull, due to the bad mixing."
