    "caption": "The music excerpt starts off with a Latin band with instruments such as trombones, trumpets, upright bass, flute and latin percussion instruments. After a few seconds the band stops and a female voice starts to sing a voice that starts in the high register and moves to the low one. Right between these two moments one can hear claps coming from a crowd of people. Towards the ending of the excerpt the voice finishes singing the melody and the band starts again."
