    "caption": "This is an R&B/disco funk music piece. There are multiple layers of a female vocalist singing melodically. The melody is being played by the electric guitar while the bass guitar is playing a groovy bass line. There is a funky acoustic drum beat in the background. The atmosphere is hip and the piece is very danceable. The piece could be playing for a 70s night at a dance club."
