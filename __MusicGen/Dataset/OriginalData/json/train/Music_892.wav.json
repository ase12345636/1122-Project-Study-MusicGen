    "caption": "This is a vocal performance recording of a pop music piece. It is an amateur recording. The female vocalist is singing in a rising-and-falling manner in medium-to-high pitch. The backing track consists of a simple piano tune, a groovy bass line provided by a bass guitar and a 4/4 signature slow tempo drum beat with clicks on every fourth beat. The atmosphere is sentimental and heart-touching."
