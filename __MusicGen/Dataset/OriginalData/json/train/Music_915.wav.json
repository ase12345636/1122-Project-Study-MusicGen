    "caption": "The Afrobeats song features a flat male vocal, supported by male ad libs in the right channel of the stereo image, rapping over punchy kicks, muffled claps, syncopated snare hits and pulsating synth pad chords. At the very end of the loop there is a short snippet of groovy synth bass, as the section changes. It sounds lower in quality mainly because of the bad sound selection, as the instruments are too thin and too digital."
