    "caption": "This is a space disco music piece. It is a funky version of the Star Wars movie theme. There is a lively combination of the strings and the brass sections playing the main melody while a groovy bass guitar is playing alongside them. The rhythmic background is composed of a disco type acoustic drum beat. Robotic sounds akin to the ones that can be heard in the movie are added in the music. The atmosphere is unique and danceable. This piece could be used in retro-themed parties. It could also be playing in the background at a Star Wars themed event."
