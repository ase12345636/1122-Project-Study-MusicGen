    "caption": "The low quality recording features a blues song that consists of a passionate fruity male vocal singing over harmonica licks, acoustic rhythm guitar, groovy bass and steel guitar melody. It sounds passionate and soulful. The recording is noisy and since the bass sound is leaning towards the right channel of the stereo image - the stereo image is unbalanced."
