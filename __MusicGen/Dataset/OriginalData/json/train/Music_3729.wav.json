There are ominous sound effects related to the movie such as heartbeat, a man beating a woman and a terrified female voice sounding like she is dying. There is cinematic sounding synth and a piano hitting the same high pitch note repeatedly in the theme. The atmosphere is bleak. Sounds from this track could be used as samples in beat-making. They could also be used in violent video games."
