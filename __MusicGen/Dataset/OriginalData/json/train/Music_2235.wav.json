    "caption": "This is a rock and roll music piece. There is a male vocal singer singing as the lead while other back vocals sing rhythmic back vocals at a higher pitch than the lead. An electric guitar is playing a simple and repeated tune while there is a bass guitar in the background. The acoustic drums are playing a basic 4/4 rock beat with claps simultaneous with the snare hits. There is an easygoing atmosphere in this piece. It could be playing in the background of a rock bar. This piece could also work well in sports venues."
