    "caption": "An acoustic drum is played together with an e-bass. They both repeat the same pattern. The ride is panned to the right side of the speakers. Three e-guitars are playing. One is strumming the same chords as the bassline while another one is being strummed with a mute technique playing a reggae rhythm. The third guitar is playing a solo melody on top and is panned to the right side of the speakers. This song may be playing at a bar."
