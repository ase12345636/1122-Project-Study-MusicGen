    "caption": "This is a famous disco piece. There are female vocals singing the lyrics joyfully. The main tune is played in major scale by a keyboard while it is supported by a syncopated synth bass in the background. The rhythm is kept by a repetitive electronic drum beat accompanied by percussion. The atmosphere is groovy and danceable. It is perfect for an 80s themed party setlist. It could also be playing in the background of an 80s themed bar."
