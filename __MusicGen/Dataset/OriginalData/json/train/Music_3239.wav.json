    "caption": "This is an instrumental pop-rock piece. There is a harp playing the main melody while a ukulele is strumming chords. An electric guitar and a bass guitar join the melodic background later on. A simple acoustic drum beat is in the rhythmic background. It has a joyful aura, but the sounds used are very generic. The best use for this piece could be the background of a tutorial/instructive type of video."
