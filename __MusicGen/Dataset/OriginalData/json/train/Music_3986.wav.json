    "caption": "This is an instrumental lounge music piece. There is a vague melody with reverberations of an ambient synth and occasional chord strumming from an electric guitar. The electronic drum hits are spread out at a low tempo. The general feeling of this song is chill yet also trippy at the same time. This piece could be used in a technological device release video. It could also be used in scenery shots in a movie or a TV show."
