    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of blues songs and it consists of a harmonica solo melody played over groovy bass, punchy snare, shimmering cymbals and electric guitar melody. As it was recorded with a phone, there are some whistling crowd noises, aside from the fact that the recording is in mono and noisy. It still sounds energetic and passionate."
