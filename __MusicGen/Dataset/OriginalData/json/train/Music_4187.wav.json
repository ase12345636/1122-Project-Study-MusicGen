    "caption": "This is a pop music piece. There is a female vocalist singing in a shout-like style. There is a flute and an electric guitar playing the melody with the bass guitar playing in the background. The rhythm is provided by a medium tempo acoustic drum beat. The tune is catchy. The piece is in the major key and there is an easygoing atmosphere to it. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a sit-com during the credits section."
