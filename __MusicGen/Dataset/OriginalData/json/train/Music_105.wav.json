    "caption": "This is an amateur recording of a dance performance over a latin dance music piece in the style of zumba. There is a female dance instructor shouting directions to the dancers. There is a male vocalist singing melodically in the background piece. A strong bass and a loud electronic drum beat can be heard very distinctly. The atmosphere is energetic. The quality of the recording is quite poor."
