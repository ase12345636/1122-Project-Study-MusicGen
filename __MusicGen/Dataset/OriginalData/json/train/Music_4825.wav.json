    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a pop rock song and it consists of flat male vocals counting down over addictive synth melody, energetic drums and groovy bass guitar. There are loud crowd screams in the background. It sounds distorted, loud and crushed, as it was probably recorded with a phone, but it is still energetic and exciting."
