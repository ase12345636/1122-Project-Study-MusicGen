    "caption": "This is an acoustic performance of a k-pop piece. The lead is a male vocal that is singing gently and melodically in the Korean language. He is also playing an acoustic guitar as the melodic background of the piece. The song is in the major scale which gives it this positive and uplifting aura. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a coming-of-age/teenage drama TV series that takes place in Korea. It could also be playing in the background of a coffee house."
