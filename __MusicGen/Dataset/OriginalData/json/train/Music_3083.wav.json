    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance including resonating bass, energetic drums and strings melody. The recording is in a terrible condition, as the bass is resonating much and the sound is overall muffled and muddy. There are some cheering and clapping sounds from a crowd. The listener can barely hear the instruments, as it sounds chaotic. It was definitely recorded with a phone."
