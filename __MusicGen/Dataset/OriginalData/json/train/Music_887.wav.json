    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of an Alternative/Indie song and it consists flat male vocal singing over electric guitar chord progression, thin, but groovy bass guitar, punchy kick and snare hits, soft rimshots, soft crash cymbal, shimmering hi hats and a drum break. It sounds energetic, groovy and addictive, due to the cadence."
