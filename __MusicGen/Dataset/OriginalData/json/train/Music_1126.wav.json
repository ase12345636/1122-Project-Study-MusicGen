    "caption": "This is an instrumental jazz improvisation piece with heavy bossa nova influences. There is an over-arching bossa nova syncopation not only being played by the acoustic drums in the backing track but also followed by the electric rhythm guitar and the bass guitar. The lead is a guitar solo being played by a gentle sounding electric guitar. Although there are complex chords and riffs, the general atmosphere is tranquil. This piece could be playing in the background of a restaurant. It could also be included in the soundtrack of a movie during serene scenery."
