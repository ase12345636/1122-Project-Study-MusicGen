    "caption": "This is a rock music piece. It starts with a clock. There is a female vocalist singing melodically in the Thai language. The overdriven electric guitar is strumming the chords of the main tune while the bass guitar is supporting it in the background. The acoustic drum is playing a simple but powerful beat. The general atmosphere is energetic. The piece can be used as a soundtrack in a coming-of-age drama taking place in Thailand."
