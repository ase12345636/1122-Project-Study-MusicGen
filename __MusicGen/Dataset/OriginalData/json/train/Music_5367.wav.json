    "caption": "This is an alternative rock piece. There is a male vocal singing gently and melodically at the forefront in the medium range, while a male back vocal can be heard singing at a higher pitch. A clean sounding electric guitar is playing a mellow tune with a bass guitar holding the root notes in the background. The acoustic drums are playing a basic rock beat. There is an easygoing aura to it. This piece could be used in a food/beverage commercial. It could also be playing at a sports venue."
