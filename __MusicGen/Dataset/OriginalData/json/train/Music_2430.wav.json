    "caption": "This track is characterised by a leading melody that is played on an instrument which sounds like it would be suitable in a video game like Super Mario Brothers. Behind this instrument, there is a grungy, fuzzy and dirty electric guitar being played. The drummer plays a simple beat to allow the melody to shine. The song has an energizing feel to it."
