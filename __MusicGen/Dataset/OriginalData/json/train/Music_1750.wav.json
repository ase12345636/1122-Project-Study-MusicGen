    "caption": "This is a movie music piece. Elements with sharp characters in varying ranges such as strings, cinematic synth and synth bass have been used to create a feeling of dread and hopelessness. The electronic drums have been used for crash hits to put emphasis points. There are also other unnerving sound effects. The atmosphere of the piece is ominous. It could be used in the soundtrack of a horror movie or a horror video game."
