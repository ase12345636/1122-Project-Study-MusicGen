    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a traditional pop song and it consists of an addictive female vocal singing over punchy kick and snare hits, groovy bass, electric guitar melody, strings melody and wooden percussion. There is a short snare roll, right before the bass drops. It sounds messy, a bit harsh, distorted, but also passionate, addictive and energetic."
