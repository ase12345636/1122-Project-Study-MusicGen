    "caption": "This rock song features a female voice singing at a comfortable pitch. The song starts off with the voice singing vocables. This is accompanied by the overdriven guitar playing one chord three times followed by a second chord three times which is higher in pitch than the first chord. The percussion plays a role at that time. The voice continues to sing a phrase. One guitar harmonic note keeps ringing during this part. The overdriven guitar plays a descending chord pattern. The bass plays the root notes of the guitar. The percussion plays a simple beat in common time. This song can be played in a detective movie."
