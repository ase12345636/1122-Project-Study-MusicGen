    "caption": "The low quality recording features a pop song that consists of stuttering vocal effects, flat male vocal speaking alongside female vocal, bleating goat sound effect, some percussive elements, boomy bass, crispy snare and shimmering hi hats. There are some scratching effects in the left channel of the stereo field. It sounds funny and like it is a parody song."
