The melody is being played by an acoustic guitar while a bass guitar plays a simple bass line. The electric guitar is playing delayed notes for texture. The acoustic drums are playing a basic medium tempo beat in the rhythmic background. The atmosphere is easygoing. This piece could be used during activities in a kindergarten."
