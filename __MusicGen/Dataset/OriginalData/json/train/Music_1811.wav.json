    "caption": "An acoustic drum is playing a hiphop/funk groove along with a bassline. One e-guitar is strumming a funk chord while the other guitar is playing a melody sequence and then the other guitar responds with a chord. The male voice sings in the mid to high range and at the end of the song a keyboard is playing a chord with a string sound. This song may be playing at home cleaning the house."
