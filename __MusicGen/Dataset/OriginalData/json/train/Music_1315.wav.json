    "caption": "The low quality recording features a trap song that consists flat male vocal, alongside widely spread male ad libs, rapping over arpeggiated, echoing synth melody, sustained and distorted synth melody, boomy 808 bass, punchy snare, soft kick hits, bouncy hi hats and shimmering open hats. There is a short snare roll at the end of the first part of the loop. It sounds quiet, but still energetic and exciting."
