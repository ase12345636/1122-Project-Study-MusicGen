    "caption": "The instrumental music features a sort of calm before the storm. In the low register one can barely hear a double bass playing a long note softly. Another stringed instrument plays a short melody that fades out. A bigger group of strings then play a short long-note melody. The music is playing softly, almost quiet. This could work well as music for a movie scene."
