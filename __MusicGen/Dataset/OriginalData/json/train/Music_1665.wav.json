    "caption": "This is a rock-n-roll music piece. There is a male vocalist singing as if he is telling a story in the lead. The electric and the bass guitar are playing a simple tune. The acoustic drums are playing an upbeat rhythm with a heavy use of rimshots. The atmosphere of the piece is groovy. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a romance/romantic comedy movie where the protagonist cannot stop thinking about a girl."
