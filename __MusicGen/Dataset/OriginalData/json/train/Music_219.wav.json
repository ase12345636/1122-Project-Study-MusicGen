The distortion guitars play using muted power chords lending a heavy tone to the rhythm section. The bass follows the same riffs as the guitars. The percussion plays an aggressive rock beat using double kicks in parts, following the guitar riffs. This song has a rebellious mood. This song can be played in a Transformers-style machine movie."
