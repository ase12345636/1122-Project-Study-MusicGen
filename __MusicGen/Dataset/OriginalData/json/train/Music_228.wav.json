    "caption": "The music features a male voice singing a melody while being backed at times by other male vocals. A piano accompanies the singer by playing a combination of chords and melody. For the most part a marimba plays in unison with the singer. In the low register, a synth bass plays long notes. The drummer makes use of only the hi-hat and China cymbal."
