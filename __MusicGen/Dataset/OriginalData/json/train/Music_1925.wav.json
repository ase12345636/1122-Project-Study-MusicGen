    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a rock song that contains harmonizing background vocals, alongside passionate female vocals, singing over wide electric guitar melody, punchy snare, groovy bass, punchy kick and shimmering hi hats and crash cymbals. It sounds emotional, passionate and addictive - thanks to that cadence."
