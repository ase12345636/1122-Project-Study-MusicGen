    "caption": "The low quality recording features an Acapella cover of a pop song and it consists of harmonizing mixed vocals singing and some beatboxing that mimics \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern. The recording is noisy and it sounds a bit roomy, since it was probably recorded with a phone. It sounds passionate and fun."
