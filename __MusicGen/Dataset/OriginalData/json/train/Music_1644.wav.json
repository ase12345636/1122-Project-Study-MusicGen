    "caption": "The low quality recording features a blues song that consists of filtered monotone male vocal singing over groovy bass, groovy organ keys, chords, soft kick hits, punchy snare and shimmering cymbals. The song is poorly mixed, as the vocals are not so much in the face as they should be, probably because the bass is eating the other elements - making it sound boomy."
