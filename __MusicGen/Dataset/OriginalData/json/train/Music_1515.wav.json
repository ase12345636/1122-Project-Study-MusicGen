    "caption": "This is instrumental Chinese music. The main melody is played by dizi, a Chinese flute. Qin (a Chinese xylophone) is played with syncopation while at the same time carrying the bass notes. There is also a simple acoustic drum beat in the rhythmic background. The piece has a positive, optimistic atmosphere. It could be used in the movies/shows that take place in China. It could also be used in the background of a Chinese cuisine restaurant."
