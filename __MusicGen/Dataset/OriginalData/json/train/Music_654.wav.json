    "caption": "This is a psychedelic rock music piece. There is a male vocalist singing melodically in the lead. The main melody is being played by the keyboard with the backing of the electric guitar and the bass guitar. The rhythmic background consists of a rock acoustic drum beat. The atmosphere is chill and trippy. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a drama movie or a TV series that has scenes of hallucinogenic trip sequences. It could also be playing in the background at a hippie coffee shop."
