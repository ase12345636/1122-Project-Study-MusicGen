    "caption": "The low quality recording features an electro pop song that consists of an echoing passionate male vocal singing over groovy synth keys chord progression, punchy snare hits, followed by snare roll, wide laser synths and reversed crash riser. It sounds exciting and energetic - like a build up section of the song."
