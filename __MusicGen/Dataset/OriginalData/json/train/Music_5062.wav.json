    "caption": "The low quality recording features a Twoubadou song that consists of flat male vocal singing over acoustic guitar melody, arpeggiated guitar melody, syncopated rimshots, shimmering shakers, smooth bass and wooden percussive elements. Even though it is noisy, it sounds fun and happy - like something you would want to dance to."
