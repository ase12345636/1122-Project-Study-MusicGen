An organ is playing a melody panned to the left side and a digital trumpet/guitar sound is playing a melody panned to the right side of the speakers. A soft percussion sound is creating a bassline while male voices are singing as a choir and a main singer in the foreground. This song may be playing as a live performance in an african country."
