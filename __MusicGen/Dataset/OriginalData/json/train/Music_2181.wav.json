    "caption": "This is a japanese jazz music piece that is used in an anime soundtrack. There is a female lead vocal singing gently in the lead. The melody is being played by the piano, the electric guitar and the upright bass. In the rhythmic background, there is an acoustic jazz drum beat in the style of swing. There is an exhilarating atmosphere, full of rich sounds. The mix is perfect. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a romance/drama movie as well as its original use in an anime. It could also be playing in the background at a coffee shop or a classy restaurant."
