    "caption": "This song contains digital drums playing a groove along with an aggressive synth saw wave pad repeating the same simple melody. A male kid's voice is chopped into a sample creating a rhythmic phrase. The same goes for a female voice. So it sounds like they are singing. This is an amateur recording. This song may be playing in a funny video."
