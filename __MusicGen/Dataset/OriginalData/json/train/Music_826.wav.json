    "caption": "This song contains a acoustic drum playing a lot on the toms before changing to a groove with strong crash hits. A e-guitar is playing single notes in a very high pitch while the other e-guitar is playing a melody along with the bass in a lower register. A male voice is singing, almost streaming a melody on top. A male backing voice is supporting in between the breaks of the main singer. In the background you can hear male voices shouting. That seems not to be a part of the music. This song may be playing while running with headphones."
