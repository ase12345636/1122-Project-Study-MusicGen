    "caption": "This is an instrumental progressive rock piece. The only instrument being played in the piece is a clean sounding electric guitar. There is a gently played guitar solo that gives a mellow aura. The atmosphere is dreamy. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a movie or a TV show at a dream/flashback sequence. It could be playing in the background at a rock bar."
