    "caption": "The low quality recording features a hip hop song that consists of harmonizing male vocals, alongside background male vocals in the left channel and rough, repetitive male vocals in the right channel of the stereo image, singing over addictive synth lead melody, straight synth piano chords, boomy 808 bass and snaps. Right before the bass drops, there is a short snare roll. It sounds groovy and addictive, like something you would hear in clubs a lot."
