    "caption": "An acoustic drum is playing a rock groove with a big emphasis on the ride and silent hits on the crash. Along with the drums a electric bass is playing a bluesy line and so does the guitar. Another e-guitar is strumming chords. The whole song sounds fast and may be playing at a local festival where people are dancing."
