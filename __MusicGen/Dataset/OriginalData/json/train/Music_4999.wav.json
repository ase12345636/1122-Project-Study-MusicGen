    "caption": "The rock and roll music features a male voice singing a melody and at times singing in unison with a male backing voice. The band that accompanies the singer consists of a drum kit playing a light and simple rhythm, a bass guitar that plays in the style of walking bass, and a section of saxophones. On top of this recording one can hear a rattle that sounds close to a baby shaker toy. The recording quality is not that good, which leads me to believe it's an amateur phone recording of a speaker playing the song."
