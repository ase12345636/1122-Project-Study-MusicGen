    "caption": "The Electro song features a \"4 on the floor\" boomy 808 bass, shimmering shakers, muffled syncopated snare, repetitive short male vocal chants, high pitched female vocal and frequency sweep riser. It sounds funny, groovy and energetic. The drums are stuttering at one point, which serves as a transition to the next section."
