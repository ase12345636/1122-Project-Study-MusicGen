    "caption": "This song contains someone playing a melody with a flute in a higher register. The flute sounds offkey. An e-guitar is fingerpicking two chords. In the background you can hear percussive instruments and an e-bass. A male voice is talking/shouting sounding as if he wants to motivate the listener. This song may be playing live in a big bar or during an event in a latin.american country."
