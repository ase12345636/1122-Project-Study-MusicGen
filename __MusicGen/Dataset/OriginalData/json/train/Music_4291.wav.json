    "caption": "The song is an instrumental. The song is medium tempo with a cool groove being played on a keyboard. The ambient sounds are that of a gardening hardware tool being conked into starting with wind noise and gravel crunching tones. The song is being played as background music for the home video. The audio quality is harsh and not pleasant to hear."
