    "caption": "This file contains a backing track with acoustic drums holding a steady groove without any changes along with a repeating bassline. A padsound is playing in the background along with a high pitched melody entering for a moment. The e-guitar is strumming rhythmically chords along with the bass walking down the fretboard. The male voice singing sounds like not being a part of the track playing. This is an amateur recording. This song may be playing at a karaoke night."
