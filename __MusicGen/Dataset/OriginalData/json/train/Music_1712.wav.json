    "caption": "The low quality recording features a pop song that consists of filtered, wide female vocal singing over mellow piano chords, sustained strings melody and filtered drums located in the left channel of the stereo image. At the very beginning there is a snap sound and at the end, there is a short snippet of another section which contains punchy kicks layered with energetic crash cymbals and arpeggiated synth melody. It sounds emotional and energetic, even though it sounds kind of papery and thin, since it lacks lower frequencies."
