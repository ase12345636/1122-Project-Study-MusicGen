    "caption": "The low quality recording features a pop song that consists of seductive female vocal singing over arpeggiated synth lead melody, pulsating synth keys, sustained synth melody, punchy kick, claps, simple hi hats and groovy bass that glues everything together. It sounds a bit muffled, probably because of the quality of the mix."
