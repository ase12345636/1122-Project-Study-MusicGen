    "caption": "This audio contains someone playing a big acoustic drum set with a lot of fill-ins before breaking into the next part of the song. It sounds as if it is the big finale. With loud hits on the cymbals a e-bass is playing a long note and the organ is playing loud chords in the higher register. This song may be playing live at a concert."
