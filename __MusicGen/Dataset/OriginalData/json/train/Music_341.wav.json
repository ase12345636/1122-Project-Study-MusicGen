    "caption": "This song is full of rhythmic elements and an e-bass that supports the mood for dancing. A rhodes/organ is playing a simple melody along with a trumped playing its own melody. The recording is full of synth pad sound and crash hits. This song may be playing on a portable speaker while riding a bike with friends during summer."
