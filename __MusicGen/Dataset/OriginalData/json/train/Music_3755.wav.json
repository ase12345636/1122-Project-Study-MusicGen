    "caption": "This is a toy package opening video with a jazz music piece in the background. In the piece, there is a clarinet playing the leading melody while other brass elements, the piano and the upright bass are accompanying it with backing tunes. The rhythm is being played by the upbeat jazz acoustic drums. The atmosphere of the piece is lively. If the package opening sounds could be removed, the piece would suit well in the soundtrack of a feelgood animation movie."
