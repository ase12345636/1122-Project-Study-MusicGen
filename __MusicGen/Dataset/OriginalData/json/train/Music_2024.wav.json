The melodic background consists of the violin, the oud, and the qanun while the cello and the bass guitar are playing in the lower range. The rhythmic background is provided by percussive elements that sound like the doumbek. The atmosphere is vibrant. This piece could be used as an opening theme for a drama movie or a TV series that takes place in the Middle East."
