The electric guitar is playing the main tune with a keyboard and a bass guitar backing it. The rhythm is being played by the acoustic drums at a slightly fast tempo. The atmosphere is loud and aggressive. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a Celtic historical drama movie during scenes of battle."
