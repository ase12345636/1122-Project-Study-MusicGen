    "caption": "The low quality recording features a hip hop song that consists bright, widely spread steel guitar melody, tinny muffled percussive elements, shimmering triangle, reverberant flute melody, claps, soft kick hits, mellow synth pad and groovy bass that glues everything together. It sounds kind of dull, but groovy, energetic and tropical - thanks to those flute and guitar melodies."
