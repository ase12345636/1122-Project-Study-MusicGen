    "caption": "This traditional music is played on didgeridoos. There are three didgeridoos being played. They are played by vibrating the lips and blowing into the instrument. This produces the droning sound. On one of the didgeridoos, a stick is being hit to form a percussive rhythm. The other didgeridoos play a melody by opening the mouth wider and narrowing the mouth in an alternate pattern. Halfway through the song, a tambourine is played. This song can be played in a movie where tribal people have a ceremony."
