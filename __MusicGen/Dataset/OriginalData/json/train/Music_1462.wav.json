In the melodic background, a keyboard and a bass guitar repeating the same pattern can be heard. The acoustic drums are playing a loud and slightly fast-paced rock drum beat. There is a rebellious atmosphere to this piece. It can be used in the soundtrack of a teenage drama or a crime shootout video game."
