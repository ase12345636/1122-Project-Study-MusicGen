    "caption": "This is an instrumental live downtempo music piece performance with deep house elements. There is a synth bass lead while the medium-pitch strings hold the melodic background. An occasional piano riff can be heard every now and then. There is a mid tempo electronic drum beat in the rhythmic background. It has a very groovy mood. This piece could be played during earlier hours at a nightclub. It could also be used in a tech device advertisement."
