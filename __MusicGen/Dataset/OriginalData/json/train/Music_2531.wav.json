    "caption": "The low quality recording features an electro song played on a small device that reproduces thin, mono sounds, especially since it was recorded with a phone. The song consists of a repetitive synth melody, flat male vocal, \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern, claps and shimmering shakers. There are some papery sound effects too. Overall it is noisy and it sounds fun and happy."
