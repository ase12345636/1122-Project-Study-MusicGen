    "caption": "The low quality recording features a DJ scratching a vinyl of a jungle song that consists of punchy kick and snare hits layered with energetic crash cymbal and groovy bass. The song sounds thin as it is probably playing on a speaker. The recording itself is noisy and in mono. It sounds energetic and aggressive overall."
