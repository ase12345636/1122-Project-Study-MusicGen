    "caption": "This amateur recording features a vinyl scratch being played on a DJ console. This is accompanied by programmed percussion playing a simple beat at a fast tempo. The hi-hat is struck in eighth notes. The snare and kick are played in a unique pattern. A synth plays a two-note lick at different intervals. Other instruments are not audible as the audio quality is low."
