    "caption": "The low quality recording features an electro house song that consists of punchy \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern, claps, funky electric guitar melody, groovy synth keys, groovy bass that glues everything together and shimmering shakers. It sounds a bit muddy, but also energetic, fun and exciting - like something you would hear in clubs during 70s and 80s a lot."
