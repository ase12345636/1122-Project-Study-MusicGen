    "caption": "This is a jingle piece in the background of an advertisement video. There is an acoustic guitar playing a generic tune while medium-pitched strings can be heard accompanying it. There is a slightly fast-paced acoustic drum beat as the rhythmic background. Sounds can be heard related to the ad such as a blood pulse sound effect, a pingpong ball bouncing and people shouting. The overall atmosphere is generic."
