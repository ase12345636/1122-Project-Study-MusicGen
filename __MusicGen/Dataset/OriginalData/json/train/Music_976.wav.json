    "caption": "This is an instrumental flute piece. The flute is playing a solo while ambient samples of the wind and the birds singing can be heard in the background. There is also a very faint clattering bell-like percussion that can be heard. The piece is very relaxing. It could be used in a meditation video. It could also be used during the scenery shots in the soundtrack of a documentary."
