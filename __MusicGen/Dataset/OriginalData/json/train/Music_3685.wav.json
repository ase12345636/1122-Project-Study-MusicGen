    "caption": "The low quality recording features a R&B song that consists flat male vocal singing over layered repetitive plucked arpeggiated melody and synth arpeggiated melody, followed by smooth synth bass, bouncy snare, punchy kick, bright hi hats triplets and low toms. It sounds energetic and groovy, although it seems that the song is finishing, judging by the arrangement."
