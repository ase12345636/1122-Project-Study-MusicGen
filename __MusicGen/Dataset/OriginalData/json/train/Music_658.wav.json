    "caption": "This is a Tunisian folk music piece. There is an orchestra playing the main tune with the dominant sound of the strings section and the oud. There is a choir singing in the background. The atmosphere is vibrant and sentimental. This piece could be in the soundtrack of a Middle Eastern/North African soap opera."
