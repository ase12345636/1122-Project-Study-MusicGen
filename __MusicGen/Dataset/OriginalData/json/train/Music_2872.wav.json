    "caption": "The low quality recording features a R&B/Soul song that consists of snappy rimshots layered with shimmering tambourine, mellow piano melody, punchy kick, smooth bass and synth keys melody. At the very end of the loop, there is a short snippet of passionate female vocal singing over the instrumental. It sounds emotional, passionate and hopeful."
