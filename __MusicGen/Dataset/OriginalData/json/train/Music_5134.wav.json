There is an ambient synth in the background playing the melody with the accompaniment of an acoustic guitar. A mellow bass guitar plays a groovy bass line. The rhythmic background consists of an electronic drum beat full of percussion samples. The piece has a trippy aura. It could be played at nightclubs. It could also be used in the soundtracks of drama films with a modern, urban setting."
