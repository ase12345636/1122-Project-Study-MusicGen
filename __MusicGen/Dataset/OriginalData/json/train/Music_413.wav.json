    "caption": "The Drum & Bass song features wide piano chords layered with wide synth pad chords, followed by echoing vocal melody at the beginning, double pedal kick, punchy snare and manically played hi hats. Right before the beat drops, there is a wide reverberant riser that lifts the energy of the track, preparing the listener for it. It sounds energetic, uptempo and manic - like something you would hear on commercials."
