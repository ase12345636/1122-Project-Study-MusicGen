    "caption": "The low quality recording features a DJ scratching effect at the beginning of the loop, after which a synth wave song drops. The song consists of groovy synth bass, percussive tinny elements, shimmering hi-hats, punchy snare and kick hits, soft crash cymbals and wide simple bells melody. It sounds energetic and judging by the arrangement, it's a background song for some kind of video."
