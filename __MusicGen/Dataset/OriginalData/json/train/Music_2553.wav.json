    "caption": "This song contains someone playing a blues melody on the acoustic piano along with an e-guitar and an e-bass. The acoustic drums are playing a constant rhythm while male deep voice is backed by higher sounding male voices singing harmonies along with him. Then a male voice starts talking that seems not to be part of the musical composition. This song may be playing in a cafe."
