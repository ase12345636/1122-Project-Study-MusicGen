    "caption": "An acoustic drum is playing along with a bassline giving the song a ska/reggae feeling. The e-guitar strumming on the offbeat supports that feeling while a keyboard is playing a bell-sounding chord. Bongos are setting little accents at the end. A saxophone is playing a melody along. This song may be playing at a festival outside while the sun is shining."
