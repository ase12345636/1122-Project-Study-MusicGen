    "caption": "The music features a stringed instrument playing a melody. I'm not sure what instrument it is, it sounds oriental. I can say for sure it's not an acoustic guitar. This instrument has a synth delay effect on, meaning whenever a note is played, a device plays that same note with the sound of a synth."
