    "caption": "A cello section is playing a short stroke melody with the bow while other strings, probably violins are playing a one note drone in a high key. Timpani hits and rolls are adding depth to the musical scenario. In the background you can hear sound effects opening up the soundscape for a deeper male voice screaming/crying along to a chainsaw sound. This song may be playing in a movie scene where someone is getting tortured."
