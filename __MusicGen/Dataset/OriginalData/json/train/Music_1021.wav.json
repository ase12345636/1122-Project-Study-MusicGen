    "caption": "The Alternative/Indie song features a mixed background choir singing over punchy kick and snare hits, energetic cymbals that include crashes and ride hits, followed by groovy bass and strings section melody. The instrumental probably contains more instruments in the background, like a brass section or something orchestral, but due to the low quality mix of the song, it is not audible. Sounds epic and energetic, almost like a final boss theme song for video games."
