    "caption": "This song contains two acoustic guitars picking a melody. A digital drum is playing a simple groove when a male voice starts to sing in a higher register with backing vocals. Then the melody drops one octave. The guitars are panned to the left and right side of the speakers. This song may be playing on a road trip with friends."
