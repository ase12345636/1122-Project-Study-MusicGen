    "caption": "This is a Japanese pop-punk music piece. There is a teen female vocalist singing merrily and melodically in the English language. There is a distorted electric guitar playing the main tune with a bass guitar. The rhythmic background consists of a fast-paced punk beat being played on the acoustic drums. The atmosphere is uplifting. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a teenage/young adult feelgood movie/TV show. It could also take place in the soundtrack of an animation movie or an anime."
