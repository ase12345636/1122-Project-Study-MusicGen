    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a country song that consists of an acoustic rhythm guitar, groovy bass guitar, shimmering hi hats, simple kick, punchy snare and steel guitar repetitive melody. At the end of the loop, there is a short snippet of passionate male vocal singing, while at the beginning there is a crowd clapping sound. It sounds joyful and addictive."
