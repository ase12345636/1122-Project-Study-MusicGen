    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a jazz song and it features a passionate female vocal singing over shimmering hi hats, groovy piano chords and smooth double bass. The recording has some audio crackles and that would be the only reason for it to go under the \"low quality\" category. It sounds emotional, passionate and groovy."
