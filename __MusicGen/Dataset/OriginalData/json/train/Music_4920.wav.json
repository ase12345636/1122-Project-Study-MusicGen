    "caption": "This song contains a digital/acoustic drum holding a simple groove with an e-bass while two distorted e-guitars are playing a melody with one being the lead. A male voice is singing in a higher register while you can hear hand clapping to the rhythm. This is an amateur recording and in poor audio-quality. This song may be playing at a live concert."
