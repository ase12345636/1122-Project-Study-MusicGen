The main melody is played by a wide variety of the winds section composed of the saxophone, the trumpet, the flute and the clarinet. The piano and the upright bass provide backing structures. The rhythmic background consists of a jazz acoustic drum beat. The atmosphere is playful. This piece could fit perfectly in the soundtrack of a Disney-type animation movie."
