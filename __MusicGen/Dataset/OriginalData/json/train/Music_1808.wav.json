    "caption": "This is the guitar cover of a speed metal/progressive metal piece. The distorted electric guitar is playing a solo. There is a rapid and complex procession of notes in the solo which is played by the shredding technique. There is a loud and violent atmosphere to the recording. The quality is quite poor since the recording is a bit dated."
