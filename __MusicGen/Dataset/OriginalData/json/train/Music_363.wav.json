    "caption": "The Low Quality Hip Hop song features a dry, flat male vocal rapping over punchy kick layered with shimmering open hats, punchy kick, simple hi hats, claps, syncopated snare hits, wide arpeggiated synth melody and stuttering synth chords. It sounds energetic and kind of unnatural, since the vocal is so detached from the instrumental due to the bad mixing of the song."
