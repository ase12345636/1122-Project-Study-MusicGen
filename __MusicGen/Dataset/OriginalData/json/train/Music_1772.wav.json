    "caption": "The music features a glockenspiel playing a melody that starts off with a few notes and then develops into a fast-note arpeggio melody. Electronic sounds accompany the glockenspiel with a style that combines bass notes on beats one and three and chords on beats two and four. The whole atmosphere is playful."
