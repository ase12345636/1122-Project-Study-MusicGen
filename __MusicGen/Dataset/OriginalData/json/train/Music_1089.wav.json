    "caption": "The low quality recording features a reggae song sung by low flat male vocals, followed by repetitive synth lead melody, groovy bass, vocal chants, claps, punchy kick hits, shimmering hi hats and open hats. It sounds energetic, suspenseful and it is in mono. At one point the vocal cracks and it sounds out of tune for a split second."
