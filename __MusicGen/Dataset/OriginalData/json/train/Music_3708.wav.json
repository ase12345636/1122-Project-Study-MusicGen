    "caption": "The low quality recording features a cover of a pop song and it features passionate female vocal singing over acoustic rhythm guitar. There is a quiet playback playing in the background - it sounds like it is coming from headphones. The recording is a bit resonant and noisy, but it sounds emotional and heartfelt regardless."
