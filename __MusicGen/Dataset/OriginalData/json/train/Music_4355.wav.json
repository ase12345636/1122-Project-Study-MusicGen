    "caption": "This hip-hop song features a high pitched voice sounding like a cartoon voice singing the main melody. The quality of the recording is low and some of the instruments cannot be identified. The voice is accompanied by a flute in the beginning and then a piano fill. A synth plays chords in the background. This song can be played in an animated movie."
