    "caption": "An e-bass is playing a funky bassline with a drumbeat that sounds like the high frequencies have been filtered out. You can hear a lot of background noises that do not belong to the recording. Such as a dog barking, glass shattering, a male voice shouting and a female voice singing. All these sounds are using a reverb. This song may be playing as part of a movie scene."
