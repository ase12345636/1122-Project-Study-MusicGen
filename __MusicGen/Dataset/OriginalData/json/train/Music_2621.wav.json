    "caption": "This is a Finnish pop piece. There is a male vocalist singing melodically in the Finnish language. In the background, a clean guitar and a groovy bass guitar can be heard playing the theme with the accompaniment of a keyboard. An 80s disco type beat is being played by the acoustic drums in the rhythmic background. There is a danceable aura to it. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of teenage dramas taking place in Finland. It could also be used in retro-themed disco party playlists."
