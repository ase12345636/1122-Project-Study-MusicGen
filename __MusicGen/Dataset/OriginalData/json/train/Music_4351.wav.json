    "caption": "This music is a cheerful instrumental. The tempo is medium with the lead harmony on a Xylophone, energetic drumming, keyboard accompaniment and rhythmic acoustic guitar. The audio quality is inferior and the music is muffled and muddy. There are background sounds like people talking, laughing and ambient nature sounds like a breeze. The music is fun, youthful, simple, enjoyable, chirpy and vivacious."
