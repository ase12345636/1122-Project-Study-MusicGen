There is a brass section and a piano that are playing the melody while the upright bass is playing a simple bass line. The rhythmic background consists of acoustic drums and the tapping of the shoes to the ground. There is a lively atmosphere. This piece is used in the background of comedic social media content or advertisement jingles."
