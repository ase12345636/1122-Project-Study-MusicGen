    "caption": "This is an animation theme. There is a brass section playing the melody with the saxophone being the lead. The hi-hat cymbals are played with a feeling of swing on the acoustic drums. The atmosphere is sneaky and filled with intrigue. These characteristics make it a perfect soundtrack for a heist/detective cartoon or an animation movie. It could also work well in the soundtrack of a video game from a similar genre."
