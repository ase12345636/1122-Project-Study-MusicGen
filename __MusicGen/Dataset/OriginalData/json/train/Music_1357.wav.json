    "caption": "The Country song features a passionate male vocalist singing over accordion melody, groovy bass, layered \"4 on the floor\" kick and cowbell pattern, soft crash cymbal, shimmering shakers and acoustic rhythm guitar. It sounds fun and happy, even though the song is poorly mixed, as it sounds a bit boomy."
