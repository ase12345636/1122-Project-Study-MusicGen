    "caption": "This is an educational pop music piece. There is a female vocalist singing out-of-tune. The strings and the acoustic guitar are playing a simple tune while the rhythmic background is provided by a basic acoustic drum beat. The aura of the piece is generic and monotonous. The quality of the recording is subpar. It might be useful in the class setting."
