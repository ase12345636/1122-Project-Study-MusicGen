    "caption": "The low quality recording features a rock song that consists of groovy electric guitar chord progression, smooth bass guitar, punchy snare and kick hits, shimmering hi hats and flat female vocals singing over it. At the end of the first half of the loop, there is a short snare roll alongside glissando organ keys melody, sliding perfectly into the next section, which begins with the energetic crash hit. It sounds energetic, groovy, and kind of vintage and warm, since it really sounds old - especially because the song is in mono."
