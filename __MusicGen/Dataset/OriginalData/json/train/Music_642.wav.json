    "caption": "This is a fast tempo song. The audio quality is inferior so the vocals are muddled making it difficult to comprehend if the vocalist is a male or female. The music is incoherent too but it is possible to identify synth arrangements, intense drumming, boomy bass lines,and keyboard harmony with spirited vocals. The song is upbeat and has a dance groove. It is a pop rock/ synth rock."
