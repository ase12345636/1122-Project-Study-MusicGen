    "caption": "This is a dance song which would fit in the afrobeats genre. There's a rhythmic vibrant synth with a fuzzy tone playing the main instrumental melody. There's also a groovy bassline. The percussion includes intermittent hits on a bongo drum, clapping hands, and a kick drum. This would be a good afrobeats club song."
