    "caption": "This is an amateur cover of a grunge rock music piece. Both the recording and the playing are of poor quality. There is a male vocalist singing in a grunt-like manner as the lead. A crunchy riff is being played by the distorted electric guitar and the bass guitar while the acoustic drums are playing a simple rock beat. The atmosphere is rebellious and noisy."
