    "caption": "This is a live acoustic performance of an Irish folk music piece. The chords of the piece are being played by two acoustic guitars in the background while a violin is playing the main theme which is in medium-to-high range. Since the piece is being played at a pub, the sounds of the place can also be heard in the recording. There is a jovial atmosphere. This piece can be played at Irish pubs."
