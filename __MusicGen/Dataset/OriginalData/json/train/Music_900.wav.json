    "caption": "The low quality recording features a soul instrumental that consists of a mellow arpeggiated acoustic guitar melody, shimmering tambourine and soft low tom hits in the background. There are some guitar strings crackle sound effects and at the end of the loop there is a sustained string swell. The recording is noisy and muddy, but it sounds emotional."
