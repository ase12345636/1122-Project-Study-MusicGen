    "caption": "This is an Indian folk music piece. There is a haunting female vocal in the lead. There is a group of strings which sound similar to Esraj being heard playing the main tune. In the rhythmic background, there are bell percussion that sound like manjira and membranous percussion that sound like tabla. The atmosphere is trippy. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of an exotic movie or could be sampled to be used in beat-making. It could also be playing in the background of an Indian cuisine restaurant."
