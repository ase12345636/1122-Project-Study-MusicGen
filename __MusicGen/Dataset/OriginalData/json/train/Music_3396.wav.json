    "caption": "This is an acapella version of a swing jazz music piece that was performed with various layers of a vocal synth software called vocaloid. Three different harmonies can be heard from this vocal synth. There is a bass guitar playing a walking bass line in the background. The rhythmic background consists of finger clicks and a swing jazz beat performed with brushes on a snare drum. The atmosphere is cheerful but eerie. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of an arcade/analog type video game. It could also work well in the soundtrack of an anime."
