    "caption": "This is a dub/jazz music piece. There is an electric guitar playing the main melody while a fat bass guitar is supporting it in the background. The rhythm is being played by a laid-back acoustic drum beat. The atmosphere is chill and trippy. This piece could be playing in the background at a dance club for a slow dance night. It could also be used in the soundtrack of a romance movie that takes place in the city, especially during intimate scenes."
