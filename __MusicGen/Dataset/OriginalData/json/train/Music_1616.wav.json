    "caption": "The marimba takes the lead melody along with an acoustic piano providing some underlining jazzy chords with a lot of changes. The upright bass sounds round and quiet. The acoustic elements are providing latin grooves. The instruments are all slightly panned to the left and right side of the speakers. This song may be playing in an elevator."
