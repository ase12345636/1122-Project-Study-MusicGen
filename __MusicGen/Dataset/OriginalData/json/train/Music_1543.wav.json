    "caption": "This song contains a female kid's voice singing with a little reverb and delay in her voice. An e-bass is playing a simple line along with a piano playing major chords. Panned to both sides of the speakers you can hear different percussive elements such as ride cymbal hits, shaker and bongos. Another keyboard sound is playing the main melody taking turns with the singer. Some twinkling sound adds single notes on top to round up the lullaby. This song may be playing for a kids tv-show."
