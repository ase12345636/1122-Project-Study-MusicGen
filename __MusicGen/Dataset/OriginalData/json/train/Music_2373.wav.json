    "caption": "This is an Egyptian music piece. There is a heavy use of percussion in the rhythmic background with the accompaniment of occasional claps. Medium-pitched strings are leading the melody. The male vocals are chanting rhythmically while the female vocal is singing in a soothing manner that creates a contrast in between the two elements. There is an adventurous, suspense-filled feeling. This piece could be used in a mystery/thriller video game. It could also be used in a movie that takes place in the Middle East."
