    "caption": "The Rock song features a passionate male vocal, alongside harmonizing male vocals, singing over wide electric guitar melody, groovy bass guitar, punchy kick and snare hits and some shimmering cymbals. It sounds energetic and kind of addictive thanks to those harmonizing vocals - like something you would hear on a radio during the 00s."
