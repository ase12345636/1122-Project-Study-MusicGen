    "caption": "The low quality recording features a compilation of mumbling male vocal, screaming male sound effect, glass shattering sound effects alongside metallic hits, male grunts and reverberant impact. The recording ends with the applause. In-between every single sound there is a loud static sound - which makes it sound like the channels are changing on a TV. It sounds chaotic and manic."
