    "caption": "The low quality recording features a jazz song cover that consists of a passionate saxophone melody played over soft hi hats and kick hits, snappy rimshots, smooth bass, organ keys chords and mellow piano chords. It sounds emotional, passionate and reverberant - as it was probably recorded in a medium size room."
