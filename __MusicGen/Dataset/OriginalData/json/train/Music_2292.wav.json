    "caption": "The low quality recording features an electro song that consists stuttering \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern, punchy snare, shimmering hi hats and open hats, soft crash cymbal, repetitive synth melody, spacey, echoing synth lead melody, buzzy synth bass and fading out stuttering female vocal sound effects. It is reverberant, messy, crushed and thin, as the frequencies are clashing with each other, but it still sounds energetic."
