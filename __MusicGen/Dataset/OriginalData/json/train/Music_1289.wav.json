    "caption": "This techno song features a male voice narrating a line. The song starts off with programmed percussion playing the kick and sleigh bells on alternate counts of the bar. A sliding sound is heard in the background like a sleigh on snow. The volume of the sliding sound increases in volume toward the end. A vinyl scratch is played two times. Toward the end, the instruments pause and a male voice narrates a line. This song can be played in a promotional video about a Christmas DJ party."
