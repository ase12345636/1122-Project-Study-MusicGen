    "caption": "This is a song that's led by the deep bellowing hum of the didgeridoo. We hear a wooden percussion instrument keeping a consistent timing in four over four tempo throughout the whole clip on each beat. There are two other percussion instruments, one deep and one in a higher register, and those play a rhythm intermittently throughout the clip. This kind of music is suitable for meditation or any kind of spiritual south asian experience."
