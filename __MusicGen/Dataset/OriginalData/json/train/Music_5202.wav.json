    "caption": "This heavy metal song features a high pitched male voice. This is accompanied by percussion playing an aggressive metal beat. The kick drum plays double kicks matching the picking pattern of the guitars. The distortion guitars play twin parts. One guitar plays the low parts while the other plays the same riff at a higher octave. The bass guitar follows the distortion guitars and plays the notes from the same riffs but ending earlier than the guitars. This song has a romantic theme. This song can be played in a superhero movie."
