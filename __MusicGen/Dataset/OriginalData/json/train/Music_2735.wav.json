    "caption": "The low quality recording features a jazzy song that consists of shimmering hi hats, repetitive cowbell, snappy rimshots and smooth bass in the right channel, short brass stabs and groovy piano chords in the left channel of the stereo image and electric guitar solo melody in the middle. The stereo image of the song is a bit unbalanced, due to the spreadness of low frequency sounds throughout the stereo image. It sounds easygoing and percussive."
