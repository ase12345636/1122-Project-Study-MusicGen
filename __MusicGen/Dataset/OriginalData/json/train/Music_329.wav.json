    "caption": "This is an electro swing/funk music piece. It is an instrumental piece. There is a brass section making up the most of the melody with the saxophone as the lead. The bass line is being played by the tuba. There is also a piano adding texture to the melody. The rhythmic background is provided by an electronic drum beat. The atmosphere is upbeat and eccentric. This piece could be playing at a nightclub or a dance club. It could also work well in the soundtrack of a comedy animation movie."
