    "caption": "The Reggae/Dub song features a subtle funky electric guitar melody with echoing guitar pedal effects on, punchy snare, soft kick hits, groovy bass and shimmering cymbals, while the wide harmonizing male vocals are singing over it. It sounds easygoing and chill, like something you would listen to on a beautiful Sunday afternoon."
