    "caption": "The low quality recording features a trap song playing in the background that contains stuttering snares, scratching effects and male vocals that occasionally change the pitch, while there are male exciting screams, hyping it out. The recording is very noisy, mostly from the wind and it sounds like it was recorded with a phone."
