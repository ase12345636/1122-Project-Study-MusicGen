    "caption": "This epic song features a pulsating synth playing in eighth notes in the background. The clip starts with a crash cymbal being struck. A flute plays a melody and an angelic voice sings the same melody using vocables. A bass drum alternates between one stroke and two strokes played at alternate counts of each bar. This song has an epic feel. The mood is motivational. This song can be played in a slow motion clip of an athlete winning a race."
