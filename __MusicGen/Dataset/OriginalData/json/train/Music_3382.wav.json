    "caption": "This is an Irish folk music piece. There is no singer. The main melody is being played by the uilleann pipes and the fiddle at a high pitch. The acoustic guitar is playing a rapid procession of chords in the background. The atmosphere is lively. This piece could be playing in the background at an Irish pub. It could also be used in the soundtracks of movies and TV shows that have a theme with an Irish influence."
