    "caption": "This is a live performance of a recital. A loud accordion is holding the melodic background as the clarinet performs a solo on top of it. There is also a now (Romanian pan flute) being played. A male voice starts speaking on the recording possibly retelling a story or a poem. There is a tragic atmosphere. This piece could be used in the soundtracks of drama movies or TV series with an Eastern European/Balkan setting."
