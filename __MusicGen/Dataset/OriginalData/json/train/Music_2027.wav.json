    "caption": "The low quality recording features an old video game song that consists of sustained synth strings melody, mellow percussions, groovy, thin bass and synth pad chords. The recording is very noisy and the stereo image is unbalanced as it is leaning towards the left channel. It sounds a bit glitchy and slightly detuned too."
