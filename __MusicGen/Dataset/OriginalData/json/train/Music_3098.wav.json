    "caption": "The Latin Music features a \"4 on the floor\" punchy kick pattern, shimmering shakers, groovy bass that glues everything together, staccato brass melody and repetitive flat male vocal singing over it. The song is gradually speeding up, bringing the energy up along with it. It gives off happy and fun vibes as it sounds like something you would want to dance to."
