    "caption": "This is an instrumental progressive rock piece. There is an electric guitar playing an arpeggio in the melodic background while another is playing a solo as the lead. A simple 4/4 rock beat is with electronic drum sounds. The atmosphere has a trippy, psychedelic feeling to it. This piece could be used in the trip/nightmare sequences of retro themed horror movies."
