The rhythm is being provided by an acoustic drum beat. The atmosphere is lighthearted. The piece has a slow tempo. The song is in major key. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a romantic comedy movie, especially during the scenes where the characters are reminiscing about the good old days."
