    "caption": "The low quality recording features a rock song that consists of flat male vocal singing over punchy snare, soft kick hits, repetitive organ keys chords, shimmering hi hats and groovy bass. It sounds messy, loud, muddy and chaotic, since the frequencies are clashing with each other due to a bad mix."
