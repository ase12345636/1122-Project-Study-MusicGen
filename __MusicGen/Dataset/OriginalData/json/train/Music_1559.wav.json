    "caption": "This slow pop song features a male voice singing the main melody. Another male voice sings backing voices in harmony with the main melody. A synth plays the same melody as the main voice using staccato notes. This is accompanied by percussion playing a trap beat. The bass plays the root notes of the chords and flourishes during chord changes. The bass notes are played without pausing in between notes. Instead, the notes are slid into each other. The mood of this song is romantic. This song can be played in a heartbreak scene in a romantic movie."
