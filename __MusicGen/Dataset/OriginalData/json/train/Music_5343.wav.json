    "caption": "The low quality recording features a country blues song that consists of fruity male vocal singing over groovy electric guitar melodies, groovy bass, shimmering cymbals, mellow snare, soft kick hits and clapping. The recording is a bit noisy, as it is vintage, and it sounds passionate, groovy, uptempo and cool."
