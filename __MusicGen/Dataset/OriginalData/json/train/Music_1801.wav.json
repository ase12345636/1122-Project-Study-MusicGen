    "caption": "This is a chant to a deity that is venerated in Yoruba, Candomble and Santeria religions. There are many people chanting in a devotional manner to this deity. There are a lot of percussive elements playing intertwined syncopations. The conflict of all the sounds and voices make the piece sound like a scene from a pandemonium. This piece can be used in a nightmare sequence at a horror movie."
