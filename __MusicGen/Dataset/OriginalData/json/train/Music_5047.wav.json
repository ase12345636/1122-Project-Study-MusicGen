The high part plays four descending notes followed by two ascending notes in each bar. On the fourth bar, the strings are tapped on the second half of the bar to give a percussive effect. Then the melody continues. There are no other instruments in this song. There are no voices in this song. This is an amateur recording. This song can be played in a dreamy sequence in a movie."
