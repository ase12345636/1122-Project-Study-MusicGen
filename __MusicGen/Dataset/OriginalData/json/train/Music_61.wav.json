    "caption": "This is a video game theme. There is a cinematic string sound playing the melody while the wind sound effect implies there is a snowstorm. A male choir starts singing alongside orchestral percussive elements. There is an epic atmosphere. This piece could fit well in the soundtrack of a thriller video game where there is a face-off about to happen."
