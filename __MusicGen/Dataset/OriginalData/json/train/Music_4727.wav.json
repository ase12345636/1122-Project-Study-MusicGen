    "caption": "This is the theme of a cartoon. There is a female vocalist singing merrily at a medium-to-high pitch in the Japanese language. The melody is being played on the strings and the piano while a simple on-beat bass line can be heard being played in the background. There is a simple 4/4 acoustic drum beat for the rhythm. The piece has an uplifting atmosphere. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a children's movie. It could also be used in anime soundtracks."
