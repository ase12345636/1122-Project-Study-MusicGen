    "caption": "This song seems to be experimental. An e-bass is playing a light funky groove along with a clapping sound while other percussion's are adding a rhythm rounding up the rhythm section. A oriental sounding string is playing one single note rhythmically while another oriental and plucked instrument is playing a melody in the higher register. The whole recording sounds a little old but is of good quality. This song may be playing in the kitchen while cooking."
