The distorted electric guitar is playing a heavy riff while there is a groovy bass line. There is a loud metal beat being played by the acoustic drums in the rhythmic background. Industrial sound effects can be heard which are distinctive to the industrial and nu metal scenes. The atmosphere is aggressive and energetic. This piece could be played at a rock/metal bar. It could also be included in the soundtrack of an action movie/video game."
