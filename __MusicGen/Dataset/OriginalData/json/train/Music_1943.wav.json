    "caption": "The low quality recording features a classical song that consists of arpeggiated, soft piano melody, wide sustained string melody and a tom hit at the very beginning of the recording. The song is slowly fading in, by which we can conclude that it is an intro section of the song. It sounds cinematic, emotional, soft, mellow and passionate."
