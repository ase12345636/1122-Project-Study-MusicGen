    "caption": "This is a minimal techno music piece. There is a repeated vocal sample shouting the same thing repeatedly. In the background, a very strong bass is accompanied by the electronic kick drum to provide the rhythmic background. A dirty snare drum with heavy effects joins them later on. The piece is very danceable. It could be used in a nightclub. It could also be included in a DJ set."
