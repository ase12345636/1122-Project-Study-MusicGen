    "caption": "This piece contains a lot of reverb and the instruments are using delay to create long arpeggio landscapes and rhythms. An acoustic guitar is being picked creating an arpeggio melody. A piano is playing a countermelody with a lot of reverb. A synth bassline playing one note in a 8th note rhythm is holding the ground of this composition. This song may be playing while dancing alone in your room."
