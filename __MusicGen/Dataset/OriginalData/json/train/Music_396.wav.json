    "caption": "This is a eurodance/latin dance music piece. The words are sung in the Spanish language by a female vocalist in a seductive manner. The main theme is played by the accordion while elements such as the keyboard and the bass guitar make up the melodic background. The rhythmic background consists of a basic 4/4 electronic drum beat and latin percussive elements. There is a sensual and erotic feel to this piece. It could be playing at latin dance nights at dance clubs. It could also work well as an accompaniment piece at a latin dance course."
