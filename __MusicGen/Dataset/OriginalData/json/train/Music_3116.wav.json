    "caption": "This is an instrumental rock piece which is a jingle for an ad. There is a clean electric guitar and a high-pitched keyboard playing the main melody. There is a mild bass guitar in the background supporting the melody. In the rhythmic background, there is a rock beat being played by the acoustic drums. A zipper sound effect can be heard synchronized with the ad. The atmosphere is very generic and calm. It is most suitable as an ad jingle or music behind a tutorial video."
