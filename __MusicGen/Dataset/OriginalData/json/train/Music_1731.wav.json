    "caption": "The low quality recording features a reverberant instrumental that consists of punchy kick hits, claps, shimmering hi hats, bouncy and tinny percussive elements. There are wide echoing effects at one point of the loop. Sounds energetic and groovy, like something you would hear in underground clubs."
