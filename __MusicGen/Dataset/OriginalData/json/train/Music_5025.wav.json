    "caption": "The low quality recording features a compilation of basketball game highlights and it consists of crowd cheering and floor squeaking sound effects, followed by commentary of energetic male vocals, while a R&B song is playing in the background. The song consists of a boomy kick, claps, shimmering hi hats, high pitched piano chord progression and passionate male vocals, alongside wide male doubling vocals, singing over it. It sounds energetic and exciting."
