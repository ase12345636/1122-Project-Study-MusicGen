    "caption": "An acoustic drum is playing a simple rock groove with some drum fills on the toms and snare along with a distorted e-bass and e-guitar playing the same line. Panned to the right side of the speaker you can hear a piano sound playing a little melody. A female voice is singing a happy sounding melody while male backing voices are supporting her. This song may be playing sitting in your room enjoying being at home alone."
