    "caption": "This is a classical music piece performed by an orchestra. There is a wide ranging brass section that has the french horn as the lead playing the melody. In the percussive background there are the tubular bells which give the piece a festive feel. The atmosphere is vibrant. This piece would fit perfectly in the soundtrack of a Christmas movie either as the opening theme or during the scenes where there is a preparation going on."
