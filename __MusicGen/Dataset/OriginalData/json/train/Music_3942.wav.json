    "caption": "The low quality recording features a reggae song that consists of flat male vocals, alongside filtered, echoing male vocal and doubling background vocals, singing over punchy kick and snare hits, energetic crash cymbals, tinny wooden percussions, groovy bass and synth keys chords. It sounds energetic, as it is upbeat and addictive, thanks to the cadence."
