    "caption": "This is a religious music piece. There is a female vocalist singing melodically in the Portuguese language with a Brazilian accent. The piano and the violin are playing a mellow tune. The atmosphere is spiritual. Although the words give the impression it is a Christian gospel, the footage in the video belongs to the site of a syncretic movement, so one should not mistakenly take it as a gospel piece."
