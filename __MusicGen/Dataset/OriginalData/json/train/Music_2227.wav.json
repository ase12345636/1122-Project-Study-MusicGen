    "caption": "The low quality recording features a hip hop song that consists of flat male vocals, alongside background male ad libs, rapping over boomy bass, punchy kick, slap snare, shimmering hi hats, tinny percussive elements and weird, funny and repetitive percussion. It sounds groovy and boomy, but also muddy and poorly mixed."
