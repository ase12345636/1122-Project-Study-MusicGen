    "caption": "The Low Quality recording features a regional Mexican song sung by reverberant male vocals over acoustic guitar chords, punchy snare and kick hits, groovy bass and funky piano chords. There is a short snare roll at one point that serves as a transition to the next section of the song. Sounds a bit muffled, as it is a live performance, but also energetic and fun."
