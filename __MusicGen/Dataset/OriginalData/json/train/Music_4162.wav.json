    "caption": "The low quality recording features a lullaby song that consists of an intimate, soft male vocal singing over arpeggiated acoustic guitar melody and wide sustained strings melody. It is a bit noisy and there is a tinny metallic impact towards the end of the loop. It sounds soft, mellow and emotional."
