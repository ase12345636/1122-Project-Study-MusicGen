    "caption": "This is an orchestral movie music piece. There is a brass section and a cinematic sounding strings section playing a dramatic tune. A percussive syncopation provides the rhythmic background. There is a faint high-pitched choir sound that is most likely coming from a synth. The atmosphere is full of suspense. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a video game or a movie at a scene that implies an imminent threat or danger."
