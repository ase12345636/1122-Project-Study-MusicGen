    "caption": "This song features a male voice singing the main melody. The instruments lend an Indian tonality to the song. The song starts with a flute solo backed by a tabla and a stringed instrument that sounds like a santoor. This is followed by a violin solo backed by the tabla as percussion. The bass plays the root notes of the chords. The male voice starts singing after the violin solo. This song has a gospel feel. The voice is mellow and carries emotion."
