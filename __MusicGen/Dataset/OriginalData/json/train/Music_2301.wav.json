There is a male vocalist singing melodically while the electric guitar is playing a catchy tune with the bass guitar playing a groovy bass line. A normal tempo acoustic drum beat provides the rhythmic background. There are a couple of sound effects in the end. The piece has an easygoing atmosphere. It is the perfect match for a jingle. It could also be used in DJ sets or remixes."
