    "caption": "Due to the sound quality and background cheering it can be assumed that this is a phone recorded audiofile. A male loud voice is singing a gospel song through a microphone that is overdriving through the speakers: He is accompanied by a tambourine, clapping and cheering from people while acoustic drums are backing him up. In the background you can hear an e-bass playing some licks as fill-ins. This song could be played in a gospel church or a disney movie."
