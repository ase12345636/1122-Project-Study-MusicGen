    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of an orchestra and it consists of loud brass melody, mellow woodwinds melody, suspenseful violin melody and muffled percussion. It sounds epic, powerful and passionate. The recording is in mono, a bit noisy and it is reverberant as it was performed in a large concert hall."
