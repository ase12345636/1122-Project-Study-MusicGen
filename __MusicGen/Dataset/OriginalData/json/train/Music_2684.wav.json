    "caption": "This is a Greek folk music piece. There is a male vocalist singing melodically and with a lot of articulation. The clarinet is playing the main theme while there is an electric guitar playing a backing tune. The rhythmic background consists of a percussion line that sounds very much like the toubeleki. There is a vibrant atmosphere. This piece could be playing in the background at a Greek cuisine restaurant or a Greek tavern."
