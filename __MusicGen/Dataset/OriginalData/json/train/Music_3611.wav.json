    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a rock song that consists of passionate male vocal singing over electric guitar solo melody, energetic cymbals, muffled snare and kick hits and groovy bass guitar. There are also some crowd noises, singing along. It sounds energetic, emotional and addictive, thanks to that cadence."
