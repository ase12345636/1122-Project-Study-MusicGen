    "caption": "The Funk song features a passionate female vocalist talking and singing over funky wide electric guitars and some guitar licks in the right channel, followed by smooth synth keys, punchy snare hits, soft kick hits, bouncy hi hats, soft crash cymbals and funky bass guitar. What makes this song low quality is the stereo imbalance - regardless, it sounds funky."
