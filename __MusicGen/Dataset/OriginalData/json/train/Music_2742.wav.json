    "caption": "The low quality recording features an electro song that consists of percussive elements, echoing hi hats, shimmering shakers, cowbell, claps and repetitive percussive bass loop. At the end of the loop, there are snare rolls and risers layered together, building up tension for the drop. It sounds exciting and suspenseful."
