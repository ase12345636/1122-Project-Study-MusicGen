There is a bass guitar playing in the background. The rhythm is provided by a ballad-type slow tempo acoustic drum beat. The atmosphere is sentimental. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a drama movie, especially during the scenes of a reunion or a homecoming after a long period of separation."
