    "caption": "A lot of high frequencies that are produced by an e-bass and two distorted electric guitars are running through amps that are sounding highly overdriven. The drums silently build up the atmosphere before all instruments are loudly breaking into the next part of the song. The drums with crash hits and the guitars and bass with one single low note while a male voice is screaming. This song may be playing at a festival."
