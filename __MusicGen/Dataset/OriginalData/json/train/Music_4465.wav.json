    "caption": "This is a low quality recording of a sped up song. The song features voices that have reached a high pitch of singing due to the sped up tempo. This is accompanied by percussion playing at a fast tempo. Distortion guitars are playing power chords but are now at a higher pitch due to speeding up the song. The bass plays the root notes of the chords. The song has a quirky mood. It can be used in a comedy movie."
