    "caption": "This song features male voices singing in harmony. It starts off on a high note, followed by a lower note and back up to a high note. At the end, a vocoder is used to give a start-stop effect to the voice. The ending of the voice is like if a person were to drive over road ramblers. There is a lot of reverb added to the voice."
