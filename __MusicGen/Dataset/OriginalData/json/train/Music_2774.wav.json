    "caption": "Two viola/cello like instruments being played with a bow and a lot of tremolo. It sounds like they are complaining and crying, full of pain. They both are playing a melody as they are talking to each other. A low basslike drumhit/kick with a long release is hitting one single note. You can hear some white noise in this recording. This song may be playing in a sad and disturbing scene of a retro movie."
