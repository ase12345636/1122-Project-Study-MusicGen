    "caption": "The low quality recording features a soul song that consists of a passionate male vocal, alongside wide harmonizing female vocals, singing over smooth piano melody, wide sustained strings and subtle, arpeggiated electric guitar melody. It sounds heartfelt, emotional and uplifting - like something you would hear in church."
