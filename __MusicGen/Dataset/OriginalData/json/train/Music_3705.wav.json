    "caption": "This rock song features a guitar solo played on a guitar with heavy distortion. The solo starts off with high pitch notes being played. This is followed by a dive bomb using the whammy bar. The guitar then plays a descending lick followed by scratch harmonics and another descending run. This is accompanied by percussion playing a powerful rock beat in common time. The bass plays the root notes of the chords. Another distortion guitar plays power chords to back the lead guitar. There are no voices in this song. This song can be used in a car chase sequence in a movie."
