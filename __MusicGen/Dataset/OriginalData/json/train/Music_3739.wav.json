    "caption": "This pop rock song features a male voice singing the main melody. A backing male voice sings the last part of the line in harmony. This is accompanied by a piano playing staccato chords. There is a momentary silence of instruments except the percussion after the chords are struck. An acoustic guitar plays chords in the background. A bass guitar plays the root notes of the chords. The percussion plays a simple beat in common time and finishes the bar with a roll. Then the drum plays with the beat with an open hi-hat. The mood of this song is happy. This song can be played in a coming of age movie."
