    "caption": "This audio contains an acoustic drum set playing fast snare rolls and then adding in a kick on every beat along with some crash hits. A synthesizer is playing a fast lead melody in the upper register. Then the song breaks into the next part and a brass/string section is playing a melody changing note on every beat together with the kick. This song may be playing for a fast paced video-game."
