    "caption": "The Hip Hop song features a passionate female vocal singing and flat male vocal rapping over piano chords, punchy kick and snare hits, repetitive synth hits and sustained strings melody. At the end of the first section there is an echoing effect on vocals. It sounds energetic and addictive, even though the audio cuts out in the middle of the chorus, straight to the verse."
