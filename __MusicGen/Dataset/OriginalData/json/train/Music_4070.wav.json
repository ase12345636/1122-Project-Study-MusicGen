    "caption": "This is a poor quality recording of a yodeling music piece. There is a male vocalist singing rapidly with the yodeling technique. The melody is being played by an accordion. There is a bass guitar playing in the background. The rhythm is provided by an upbeat acoustic drum beat. The atmosphere is cheerful. Despite the quality issue of the recording, it would suit well as a rural radio station music playing inside the car in a movie."
