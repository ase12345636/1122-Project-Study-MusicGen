The brass, the keyboard and the bass guitar are the melodic elements of this piece. In the rhythmic background, the acoustic drums and percussive elements are playing a latin type beat. The atmosphere of the piece is chill and easygoing. This piece could be played at Caribbean bars and dance clubs. It could also be used as an accompaniment piece for dancing courses."
