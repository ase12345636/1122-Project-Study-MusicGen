    "caption": "The low quality recording features a disco song that consists of passionate female vocals and wide harmonizing female vocals singing over funky bass guitar, mellow synth keys chords, funky electric guitar chords, shimmering hi hats, clapping and \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern. It sounds funky and energetic, but also thin and hollow, due to the bad mixing."
