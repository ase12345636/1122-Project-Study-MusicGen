    "caption": "A male voice is singing loud and soulfully. A saxophone is playing a slight variation of the singer's melody. A piano is playing bluesy/jazzy chord chops accompanied by an electric organ playing along with the melody. Panned to the left side of the speaker, a e-guitar is playing one single chord as a rhythmic element. The e-bass is playing a line along with a simple rimshot and shakers that are barely noticeable. This song may be playing at a live concert."
