    "caption": "The drums and the upright bass are playing in a bluesy, country vibe with a half open hi hat. An acoustic guitar is strumming chords that are almost not noticeable. The e-guitar is playing a loud lead melody in the foreground while a violin is playing short bowed notes along. This is an amateur recording. This song may be playing in a bar."
