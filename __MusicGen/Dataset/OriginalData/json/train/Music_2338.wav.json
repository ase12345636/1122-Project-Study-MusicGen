    "caption": "Someone is splaying a series of bell sounds and a big gong hit that rings out for a long time. Wild percussive hits are being played for a moment. Then a traditional string instrument takes over playing a single long note with a bow and a lot of vibrato. This is an amateur recording and of poor audio-quality. This song may be playing in a traditional festival."
