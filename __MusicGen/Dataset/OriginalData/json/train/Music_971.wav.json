    "caption": "The low quality recording features a rock song that consists of wide electric guitar chord progressions, distorted bass guitar, shimmering hi hats, uptempo kick pattern and punchy snare. This instrumental sounds a bit muffled and imbalanced in volume, as the guitars are really loud, but it is very energetic regardless."
