    "caption": "The low quality recording features a bossa nova cover of a rock song and it consists of soft female vocals, alongside wide harmonizing vocals, singing over shimmering cymbals, snappy rimshots, funky electric guitar chords, smooth bass and mellow synth keys melody. It sounds jazzy and easygoing, like something you would hear as a live performance in a high end restaurant or jazz club."
