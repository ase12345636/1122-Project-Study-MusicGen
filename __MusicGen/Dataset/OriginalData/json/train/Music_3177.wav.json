    "caption": "This rocksteady song features a male voice singing the main melody. This is accompanied by percussion playing a simple beat. The bass is played on a double bass in a rock and roll style progression. A trumpet plays a fill at the end when the voice pauses. There are other instruments being played, but the quality of recording is low and the instruments are not heard clearly. The mood of the song is happy."
