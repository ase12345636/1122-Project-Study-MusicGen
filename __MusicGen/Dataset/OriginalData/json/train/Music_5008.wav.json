    "caption": "This is a live DJ performance. There is a groovy bass line and a mellow electronic drum beat in the rhythmic background accompanied by the tune of a melodic guitar sample. The turntable is used to make a scratching sound over this track. There is an urban feeling to this piece. It could be used in the soundtrack of a crime movie/TV show taking place in the big city. It could be used in the background of an interesting sports video."
