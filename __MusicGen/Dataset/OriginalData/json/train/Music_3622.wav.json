    "caption": "This is the comedic mashup used as a video game theme. There is a synth and an electronic drum beat playing the theme of \"I'm a Barbie Girl\". There is a male vocal and a female vocal singing in an automated fashion in the English language but with a German accent. They are singing the same tune as \"I'm a Barbie Girl\" but with different lyrics. There is an 8-bit sound effect related to the game. There is a sarcastic atmosphere in the piece, but it is also a bit bizarre in nature."
