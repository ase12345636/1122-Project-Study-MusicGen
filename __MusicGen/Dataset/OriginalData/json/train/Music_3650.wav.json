    "caption": "This song has some experimental sounds. The string instrument sounds processed and slightly oriental. The synth plucks sound as running through different effects that are changing the bit rate and some filters. These elements are panned to the right and left and right side of the speakers playing different melodies. An acoustic drum is holding the whole construct together while an e-bass is playing his own run along with the drums. An e-guitar is playing long single chords. This song may be playing in an adventurous indie-videogame."
