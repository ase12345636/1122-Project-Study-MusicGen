    "caption": "This is the recording of an ice cream truck jingle. Engine sounds from the truck can be heard in the recording. It has an analog sounding high-pitch synth playing a cute melody in the major key. The atmosphere is happy and childlike. This piece could be used to lift samples from. It could also be added to the soundtrack of children's movies and TV shows. Another good use would be in the soundtrack of video games of the arcade genre."
