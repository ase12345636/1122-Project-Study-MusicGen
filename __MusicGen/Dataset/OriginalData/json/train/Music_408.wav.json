    "caption": "The low quality recording features a jungle track that consists of bouncy snare, soft kick, shimmering shakers, energetic ride cymbal, claps and groovy bass. There are some zipping sound effects, alongside energetic female vocal phrases. It sounds energetic, but yet smooth. Sounds like a soundtrack for a commercial."
