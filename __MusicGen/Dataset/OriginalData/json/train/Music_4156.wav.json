    "caption": "The low quality recording features an uptempo chiptune song playing in the background with some synth bells sound effects. In the second half of the loop, there is a loud static noise. The recording is in mono, thin - as it lacks bass frequencies, crushed - due to the harsh mid range frequencies and it sounds like a video game sound."
