    "caption": "The Disco song features a passionate male vocal, alongside harmonizing background vocals, singing over sustained strings melody, piano melody, brass melody, punchy kick and snare hits, shimmering hi hats and some claps. It sounds funky, addictive and passionate - like something you would hear in clubs during the 70s."
