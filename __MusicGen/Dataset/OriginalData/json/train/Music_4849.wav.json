    "caption": "The Disco song features a widely spread electric guitar chord progression, acoustic rhythm guitar, shimmering shakers, tinny percussive elements, followed by simple kick pattern, punchy snare and groovy bass guitar, over which sings the flat male vocal. It sounds energetic, fun and exciting, as it is something you would definitely hear in clubs during 70s and 80s."
