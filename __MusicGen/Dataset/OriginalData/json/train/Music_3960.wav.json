    "caption": "The drums is playing a beat that reminds of a slower version of reggaeton along with some shakers and other percussive elements that are slightly panned to the right side of the speakers. An e-bass is helping to create a mood for dancing. A plucked string instrument is playing an oriental melody accompanied by a string-section playing along and adding little melody-licks. You can hear some backing vocals shouting to the rhythm. This song may be playing at a cafe."
