    "caption": "This is a rock and roll piece used as an accompaniment for a dance. There is a male vocal singing at a low-to-medium pitch. The main melody is being played by an electric guitar while the bass guitar is repeating a bass line with a groovy pattern in the background. The acoustic drums are playing an upbeat 4/4 rock and roll beat. There is a raw feeling to it. The tune is catchy. This piece could be playing in the background of a sports bar or a rock bar. It could also work well at sports venues."
