    "caption": "This is a low quality recording of a veena being played. This is a classical Hindustani song. The veena plays a note bending the string to a higher note and then descending back to the original note. The audio gets cut off intermittently. Briefly, during the places where the audio is heard, a tabla is heard. There are no voices in this song. This song can be played in a conservative Indian movie featuring a wedding scene."
