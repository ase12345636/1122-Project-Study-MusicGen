    "caption": "This clip features an electric guitar played through a distortion effects pedal. At the beginning, the sound is open. The guitar plays a power chord using down strokes. After changing settings on the pedal, a chord is strummed and then arpeggiated notes are played. This produces a 'closed' sound. There are no voices in this song. There are no other instruments in this clip. This clip can be played in a demo video of the distortion effect pedal."
