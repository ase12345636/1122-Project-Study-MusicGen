    "caption": "This is an alternative country music piece. There is a male vocal singing melodically with a thick reverb effect applied to it. The main tune is being played by the electric guitar with the bass guitar backing it. The rhythm is being provided by an acoustic drum beat. The atmosphere is easygoing. This piece can be used in the soundtrack of a drama movie, especially during the scenes where a character is trying to break free from an addiction."
