    "caption": "This is a classical orchestral piece. The piece gives off the feeling of intensity and excitement. It would be used in  any scene that is thrilling and suspenseful. We hear french horns, violins and tubas. The violins are used to create a hurried moment of tension before descending back to the main motif on the brass instruments."
