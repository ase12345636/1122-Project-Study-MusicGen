    "caption": "The low quality recording features a hip hop song that consists of flat male vocals talking over reverberant female vocal melody, punchy snare and kick hits, shimmering hi hats, groovy bass and mellow piano chord progression. It has a lot of reverb on it and it sounds easygoing, chill and groovy - like something you would listen to on a car ride."
