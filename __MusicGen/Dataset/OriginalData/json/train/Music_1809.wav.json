    "caption": "The low quality recording features an explosion and glass shattering sound effects, while sustained accordion melody, muted plucked strings melody, bouncy snare, snappy rimshots, shimmering hi hats and \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern are playing in the background. The Drums are mostly panned to the left channel of the stereo image, which is making it unbalanced, although it sounds fun and happy."
