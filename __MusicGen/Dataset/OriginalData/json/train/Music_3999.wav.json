    "caption": "An e-bass is playing a bluesy bassline along with acoustic drums with a slightly open hihat. An electric piano/organ is playing one short chord as a rhythmic element adding reggae vibes along with a e-guitar strumming fast chords on the offbeat. The guitar is running through a chorus effect. The male voices are singing a simple melody. This song may be playing at a live concert before a sports-event."
