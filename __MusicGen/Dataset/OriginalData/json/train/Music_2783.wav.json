There is an upright bass playing an eighth-note walking bass line. The acoustic drums are playing a swing jazz beat in the rhythmic background. There is a smooth and vibrant atmosphere to the piece. It could be playing in the soundtrack of a video game. This piece could also be used in the soundtracks of historical drama pieces."
