    "caption": "A digital drum is playing a four on the floor groove with a kick on every beat. Other percussive sound samples have been used to spice it up and give it a little bit more dance feeling along with a funky bassline. Cowbell sounds are panned to the left and right side of the speakers. A noise/riser sound is creating a little atmosphere before fading out. A piano is playing a chord progression adding a little bit more harmony. This song may be playing at a beachbar."
