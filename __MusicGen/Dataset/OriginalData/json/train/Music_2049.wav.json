    "caption": "This is an instrumental rock-sounding gear showcase jam. There is an electric guitar playing improvised disconnected riffs with varying accentuations. There is an echo delay pedal being used on the guitar that makes the notes being played echo repeatedly in a fading manner. Due to the usage of numerous riffs, an electric guitar sample could be lifted from this piece to be used in a beat."
