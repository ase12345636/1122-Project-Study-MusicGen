    "caption": "An acoustic drum is playing a fast and complex drum groove with a lot of crash hits and double bass drum. Distorted e-guitars strumming wild chords along with an e-bass holding the melody while a male voice is screaming/singing loud and aggressively. In-between the song high and awkward laughing can be heard. This is an amateur recording. This song may be playing at a hard rock tattoo studio."
