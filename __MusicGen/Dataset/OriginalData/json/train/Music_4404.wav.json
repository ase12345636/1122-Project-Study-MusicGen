    "caption": "The Electro song features a low pitched male vocal talking over \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern, passionate female vocal melody, acid bass, claps, soft crash cymbal, shimmering hi hats and repetitive synth lead melody. Right before the drop in the second section of the loop, there is a short riser. It sounds energetic, like something you would listen to in clubs."
