    "caption": "This is the recording of a gear showcase. There is a male voice advertising an effect amp. The distorted electric guitar is playing a crunchy-sounding riff with the added effect of the chorus amp. The atmosphere is hard-hitting. Some parts of this recording could be used in heavy guitar samples for beat-making. Such parts could also work in sections of an advertisement jingle."
