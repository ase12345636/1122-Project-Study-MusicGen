    "caption": "This is a melodic death metal music piece. There is a male vocal singing using the pig squeal technique in the lead. The electric guitar with heavy distortion is playing a hard-hitting riff. There is a bass guitar playing in the background. The acoustic drums are playing a loud but simple beat. The atmosphere of the piece is violent. It could be used in the soundtrack of a horror movie or a horror video game."
