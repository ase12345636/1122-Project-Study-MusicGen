    "caption": "The low recording features a soft rock song that consists of flat, echoing male vocal singing over muffled drums and reversed synth keys melody located in the left channel of the stereo image - which makes the stereo image a bit unbalanced. The drums consist of groovy snare, punchy kicks and shimmering cymbals. At the end of the loop, there is a reversed high pitched vocal riser. It sounds thin and a bit muffled overall."
