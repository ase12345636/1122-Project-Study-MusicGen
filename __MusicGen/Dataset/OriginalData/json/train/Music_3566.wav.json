    "caption": "This is a Persian folk music piece in the style of an opera. The female vocalist is singing at a high-pitch in a manner that is filled with emotion. There is a piano in the background that occasionally supports the melody. This is a heart-touching piece. This piece could be used in the soundtracks of tragedy/drama movies, especially the ones that take place in the Middle East. It could also be used in a video game to create an aura of suspense and anticipation."
