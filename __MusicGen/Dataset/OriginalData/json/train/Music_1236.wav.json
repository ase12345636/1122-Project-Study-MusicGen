    "caption": "The Urban Latin song features an echoing male vocal singing repetitive lyrics over wide reverberant percussive elements, synth flute melody, claps, \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern, shimmering shaker, groovy bass and synth keys melody. It is uptempo and it sounds energetic and addictive, like something you would hear in clubs a lot."
