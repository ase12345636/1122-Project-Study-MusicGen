    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance with an electro song playing in the background and crowd cheering sounds. The song consists of a \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern, addictive synth bass melody, punchy snare and shimmering hi-hats. It sounds energetic and the recording is noisy as it was probably recorded with a phone."
