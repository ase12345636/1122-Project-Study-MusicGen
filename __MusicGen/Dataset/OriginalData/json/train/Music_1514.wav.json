    "caption": "The low quality recording features a traditional song that consists of a repetitive and addictive string melody, wooden percussion and shimmering cymbals. It sounds really energetic and addictive - almost like a pop song would. The recording is a bit noisy and the left channel of the stereo image is occasionally muffled."
