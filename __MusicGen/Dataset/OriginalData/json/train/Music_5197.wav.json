    "caption": "The low quality recording features a parody that contains metallic detuned percussion, funny synth lead, wide sustained string melody in the background, male and crow cough, wooden percussion hits layered with coughs and flat male vocals, alongside harmonized mixed vocals, singing over it. It sounds funny and weird - almost like a TV commercial."
