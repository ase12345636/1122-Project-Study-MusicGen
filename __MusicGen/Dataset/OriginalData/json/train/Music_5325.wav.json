    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a rock song and it features passionate male vocals, alongside harmonizing male vocals, singing over arpeggiated electric guitar melody, boomy bass guitar, punchy kick and snare hits and shimmering open hats. It sounds noisy and messy, as the frequencies are clashing with each other, but it is still groovy and emotional regardless."
