    "caption": "The low quality recording features a crumpling bag sound effect, followed by wide sad, dark arpeggiated bells melody and mellow synth keys chord progression. Overall it sounds sad, emotional and weird - since there is a very bad sample of crumpling bag sound effect over such a beautiful melody."
