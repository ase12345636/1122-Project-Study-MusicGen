    "caption": "This is a flamenco music piece being performed live. There is a female vocalist singing passionately in the Spanish language. The acoustic guitar is playing the melodic background while the rhythmic background is played by the cajon percussion and a group of musicians clapping in a syncopated manner. The atmosphere is vibrant and agitated. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a soap opera or a romance/drama movie. It could also be playing in the background at a Spanish/Latin American cuisine restaurant."
