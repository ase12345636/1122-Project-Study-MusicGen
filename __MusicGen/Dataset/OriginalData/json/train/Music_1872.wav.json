    "caption": "Someone is playing a complex groove on the drums playing along to digital strings playing in a minor key. A very low sounding e-bass is playing a bassline. Panned to the right side of the speakers you can hear a synth lead sound playing a melody in the mid-range. This song may be playing live on a drum off show."
