    "caption": "A live recording of an instrumental piano trio. The recording is boomy and low fidelity. The drumming is active and the piano playing is pretty. The drum kit features a sidestick. Electric bass is also present. Crowd noise can be heard. Sounds like gospel music that might be heard at a church service."
