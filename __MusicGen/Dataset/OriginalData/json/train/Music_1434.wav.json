    "caption": "This reggae song features a male voice singing vocals at a high pitch, almost screaming. This is accompanied by percussion playing a reggae beat. The bass plays a groovy lick and plays a chromatic run of five notes to reach the note to start the chorus. A guitar strums one chord on alternate counts. This song can be played in a Caribbean themed party."
