    "caption": "This is a hardcore hip-hop/gangsta rap music piece. There are male vocals taking turns rapping and when they are not rapping they are shouting ad-libs. There is a fuzzy synth bass playing the repeated melodic theme of the beat while the rhythm consists of an electronic drum beat with gunshot effects every now and then. The atmosphere is urban and violent. This piece could be included in the soundtrack of a crime movie that takes place in the big city. It could also be used in the soundtrack of a crime video game."
