    "caption": "The Metal song features a low throaty male vocal singing over widely spread, aggressive and distorted electric guitars, groovy bass guitar, punchy snare, energetic cymbals and double pedal kick. In the second part of the loop, the instrumental calms down, as there is an arpeggiated piano melody over which a soft female vocal is singing. Overall it sounds energetic, aggressive and manic. The male vocal in the first part of the loop is leaning towards the left channel of the stereo image, making it sound unbalanced and therefore low quality."
