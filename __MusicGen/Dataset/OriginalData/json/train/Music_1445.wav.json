    "caption": "The low quality recording features a jingle that consists of harmonizing vocals talking over snare roll, toms roll, brass melody and groovy bass, after which there is a folk song that starts playing. The folk song contains strings melody, bouncy snare, shimmering hi hats and synth keys chords. It sounds energetic and exciting, and like something you would hear on some TV show."
