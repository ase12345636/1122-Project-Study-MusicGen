    "caption": "An acoustic guitar is playing single notes of a minor chord progression alongside an acoustic piano playing a melody on itself. Then a string-section comes in for a moment elevating the emotional piece giving it a beauty and soft sadness. The instruments are slightly panned to the left and right side of the speakers. The female voice is softly singing with a little bit of reverb on her voice. This song may be playing at a theater-performance."
