There is a floghera flute playing the main tune while the oud and the bass guitar are playing in the background. The rhythm is being played by the acoustic drums. After the shout coming from a male voice, the orchestra starts accelerating. The atmosphere is lively. This piece could be playing in the background at a seaside Greek tavern."
