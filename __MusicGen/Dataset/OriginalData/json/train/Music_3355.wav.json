    "caption": "The low quality recording features an electro song scratched by a DJ. The song consists of buzzy synth bass, bouncy cowbells, stretched low pitched male vocals, punchy kick, punchy snare layered with claps and shimmering hi-hats. It sounds energetic and groovy, like something you would hear in an underground club during the 90s."
