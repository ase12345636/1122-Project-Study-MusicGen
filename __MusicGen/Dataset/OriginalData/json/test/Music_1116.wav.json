    "caption": "The low quality recording features a metal song that consists of aggressive electric guitar melody, distorted bass guitar, shimmering cymbals and muffled kick and snare hits. It sounds energetic, but also harsh, messy, distorted, muddy and loud, since the frequencies are clashing with each other. The volume of the song is dwindling occasionally, making it a really low quality sounding track."
