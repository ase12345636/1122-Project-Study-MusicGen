There is a female vocalist singing in the lead while the sound of children talking can be heard every now and then. The bass guitar is playing a groovy tune. There are wind chimes that can be noticed. The rhythmic background consists of a simple acoustic drum beat. The atmosphere is cheerful but generic."
