    "caption": "An accordion is playing short notes on the offbeat along with soft snare hits being played with brushes. A bass is playing straight, changing the note on every beat. Another accordion is answering the yodeling male voice with a short melody. The male voice is loud, clear and sings a melody in the higher register. A guitar-like instrument is strumming chords in the higher register. The instruments are panned to the left and right side of the speakers. This song may be playing at a concert in the countryside."
