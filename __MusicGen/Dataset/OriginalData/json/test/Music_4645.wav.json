    "caption": "This is a heavy metal piece from a video game soundtrack. There is a female vocalist singing melodically in the French language. The melodic background consists of the electric guitar, the keyboard and the bass guitar. In the rhythmic background there is an upbeat electronic drum sound. There is a gothic feel to the piece. This piece could work well in the soundtrack of a historical horror movie that takes place in France."
