    "caption": "This is a video game theme that is in the style of a kids song. The main melody is being played by a vibraphone while a glockenspiel can be heard adding texture. There is a medium-to-high pitch synth string sound that joins them later on. In the background, there are sleigh bells and a wind effect to imply a winter aura. The atmosphere is playful. The piece could be included in the soundtrack of a kids cartoon or a video game."
