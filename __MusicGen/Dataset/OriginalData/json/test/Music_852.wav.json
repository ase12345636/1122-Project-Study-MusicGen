    "caption": "This is an amateur recording of a rock music concert. There is an electric guitar playing the main tune while another electric guitar is starting to play a solo. A bass guitar can be heard in the background playing the root notes of the tune. There is a loud acoustic drum beat in the rhythmic background. The recording is a bit outdated so the quality is pretty low."
