    "caption": "This is a nu-metal/alternative metal music piece. There is a male vocalist singing in a harsh, shout-like manner in the lead. The main melody is being played by a distorted electric guitar with a strong bass guitar backing. There are various electronic elements such as a crowd cheering sample and an evolving synth sound adding texture to the piece. The rhythmic background consisted of a loud metal acoustic drum beat and secondary percussive elements such as steel percussion. The atmosphere is energetic and violent. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of an action-filled/shootout video game. It could also be playing in the background at a metal bar."
