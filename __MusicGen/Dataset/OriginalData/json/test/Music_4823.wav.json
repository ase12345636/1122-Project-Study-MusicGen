    "caption": "A semi-acoustic guitar is playing slow chords and the bassline at the same time while a female voice is singing/yodeling. A reverb effect is on her voice. In the background you can hear voices talking and clapping. This is an amateur recording but of decent sound quality. This song may be playing at a folkfest."
