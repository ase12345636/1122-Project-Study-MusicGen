    "caption": "The low quality recording features an electro song that consists of a gliding synth lead melody played over groovy synth keys chords, exciting synth riser, punchy snare layered with claps, shimmering shakers and punchy kick hits. It sounds energetic and exciting, due to the fact that it is a build up section of the song."
