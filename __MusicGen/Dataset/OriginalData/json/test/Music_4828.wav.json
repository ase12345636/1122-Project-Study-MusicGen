    "caption": "The low quality recording features a rock song that consists of wide electric guitar melodies, groovy bass guitar, shimmering shakers, punchy snare and kick hits, followed by aggressive tom rolls. It sounds energetic and the drums are reverberant, as they were probably recorded in a medium size drum room."
