    "caption": "The excerpt is actually a song collage and it features third songs. In the first one a male voice is singing and the song has a dance feel to it. In the second song a male voice is singing and being backed by male voices at the same time. The instruments used are more close to the rock genre. The third song lasts for a few milliseconds and so it's hard to notice anything about it."
