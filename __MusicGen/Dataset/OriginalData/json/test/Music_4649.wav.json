    "caption": "An acoustic drum is playing a light Rock&Roll groove with crash hits and emphasis on kick and snare along with a e-bass enhancing the fast paces mood and giving reasons to move the body along to the beat. Strings like a violin are adding some atmosphere with hits in the background and playing a crescendo to break into the next part of the song while male voices are singing together. This song may be playing when having or wanting a good mood."
