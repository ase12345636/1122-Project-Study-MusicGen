    "caption": "A male vocalist sings this melodic jazz/blues. The tempo is medium fast with a piano accompaniment, groovy bass lines, infectious drumming and guitar accompaniment. There is a sound of syncopated ukulele and another string instrument playing over the song. The song is melodic and ambient but the superimposed strings melody is making it chaotic, busy, confusing and confusing."
