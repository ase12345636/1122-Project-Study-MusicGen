    "caption": "This is the opening jingle of a TV show that is in the style of a mashup. There is a male voice speaking and then burping. There is a melodic pad playing at random occasions. A female vocalist can be heard singing with a keyboard melody and an electronic drum beat very briefly. Then the male voice and the pad returns. There is a chaotic atmosphere. Separate samples from this piece could be used in both beat-making and DJ sets/remixes."
