    "caption": "The Dance Electronic track features a filtered clapping, suspenseful synth arpeggio melody, shimmering open hat, subtle hi hat, tinny syncopated percussive element, groovy bongos located in the right channel and pulsating filter modulated riser that bring the energy up. In the second part of the loop there is a \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern with a slight variation, alongside wide, echoing female exhales and shimmering shakers. It sounds low quality, especially since there is a tiny audio cutout, but also energetic, like something you would hear in the clubs."
