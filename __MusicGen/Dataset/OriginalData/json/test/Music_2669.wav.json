    "caption": "The low quality recording features a hip hop song that consists of a mellow arpeggiated piano melody played over sustained strings melody, chime bell and filtered male vocal in the first half of the loop. In the second half the beat drops and it consists of a punchy kick and snare hits, shimmering hi hats and passionate female vocals singing over. It sounds passionate, groovy and emotional."
