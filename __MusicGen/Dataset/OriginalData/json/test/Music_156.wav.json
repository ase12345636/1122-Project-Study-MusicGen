    "caption": "This is a finnish techno pop piece with polka influences. There is a female vocalist in the lead singing rapidly in a manner that resembles yodeling. A male vocalist occasionally joins her at a lower pitch while singing the melody. The melodic background consists of a keyboard tune and a simple bass line. The rhythmic background is provided by an electronic disco drum beat. The atmosphere is playful and danceable. This piece could be used in the background of a comedic social media content. It could also be played at children's events."
