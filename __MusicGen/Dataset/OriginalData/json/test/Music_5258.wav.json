    "caption": "This is a pop-sounding jingle at the background of an instructive video. There is an electric guitar playing the main theme while the bass line is being played by a synth bass. In the rhythmic background, a very basic 4/4 beat is being played on the electronic drums. A ping sound effect signifies the end of the instruction in the video. The atmosphere is very generic and common-sounding. This piece could be used as a jingle in advertisements and tutorial videos."
