    "caption": "The Trap song features a very short snippet of hard 808 bass, shimmering hi hats, punchy snare and synth keys melody after which comes the second part of the loop where there is a wide filtered stuttering down sweep sound effect. It sounds like an interlude in the middle of the song."
