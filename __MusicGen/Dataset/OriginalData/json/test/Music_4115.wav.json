    "caption": "The low quality recording features a hip hop song sung with an addictive flow by flat double male vocals over arpeggiated piano melody, boomy, layered bass and kick hits, soft crash cymbal and claps. It sounds muddy and messy as the mix of the song is bad making the frequencies clash with each other - especially in the low end."
