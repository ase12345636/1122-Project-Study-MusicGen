    "caption": "This is the live performance of an indie rock/post-punk piece. There is a male vocalist in the lead. The tune is being played by the electric guitar and the bass guitar while an electronic sound effect that resembles a laser is adding texture. There is a fast and slightly off-tempo acoustic drum beat playing in the rhythmic background. The atmosphere is energetic. The piece could be playing in the soundtrack of a teenage drama TV series."
