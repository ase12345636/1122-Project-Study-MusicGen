    "caption": "The Epic Rock song features a punchy snare, punchy hollow kick hits, wide electric guitar chords, simple bass guitar, energetic cymbals, arpeggiated filtered melody, arpeggiated violin and arpeggiated synth melody over which there is a whispering male vocal at one point. It sounds like something you would hear at the end of an action movie, while credits are rolling."
