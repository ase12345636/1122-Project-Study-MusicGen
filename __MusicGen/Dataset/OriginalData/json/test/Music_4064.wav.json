    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a jazz big bend that consists of passionate trumpet melody, over groovy double bass, shimmering cymbals and mellow piano chords. It sounds reverberant, happy, passionate and fun. The recording is a bit noisy and the sound is leaning towards the right channel, which makes the stereo image unbalanced."
