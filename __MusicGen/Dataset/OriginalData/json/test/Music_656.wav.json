    "caption": "The low quality recording features a chiptune remix of a pop song and it consists of high pitched female vocal singing over repetitive synth melody, punchy \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern and shimmering bells melody at the very beginning of the loop. It sounds kind of addictive, fun and happy. The audio sounds like it was stretched."
