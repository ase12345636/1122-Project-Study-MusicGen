    "caption": "This clip features 2 distortion guitars playing a metal song. A high pitched male voice sings the main melody. This is accompanied by percussion playing a simple rock beat in common time. A bass guitar plays a bassline with a descending run. The distortion guitars play power chords followed by a guitar lick. One of the guitars plays one chord a little after the other guitar making it sound dissonant. This song can be played in an action movie."
