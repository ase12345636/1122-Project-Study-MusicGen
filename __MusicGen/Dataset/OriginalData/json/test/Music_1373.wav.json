    "caption": "This is a music production tutorial video. There is a male voice teaching a sound design technique. There is an electronic snare drum beat speeding up with a shifting pitch. A simple synth tune is playing in the background. The sounds used in the video are very common, so it would not be worth the hassle to sample these sounds. Instead, parts of the track could be used in advertisement jingles."
