    "caption": "The low quality recording features a compilation that, in the first half, contains muffled hip hop song and in the second half sad, soft rock song. The rock song contains an arpeggiated acoustic guitar melody located in the right channel of the stereo image - which makes it unbalanced, and reverberant soft male vocal singing over it. It sounds emotional."
