    "caption": "This instrumental funk song is a low quality recording. This song starts off with a bass playing a funky and groovy lick accompanied by a percussion playing a fill. Then a synth plays a lead using string sounds. This is accompanied by distortion guitars playing power chords. The bass continues to play funky fills and the percussion continues to play a fast beat. This song can be played in an action sequence in a movie."
