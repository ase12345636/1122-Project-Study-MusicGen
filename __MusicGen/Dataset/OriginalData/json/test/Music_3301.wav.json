    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a traditional song and it consists of a flat male vocal singing over sustained strings melody and mellow, subtle percussive element. There are some people talking in the background, followed by a cough. It sounds passionate and emotional, even though the recording is noisy and in mono."
