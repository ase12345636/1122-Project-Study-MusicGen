    "caption": "The low quality recording features a rock song that consists of mellow piano melody, energetic cymbals, punchy kick, punchy snare, female choir, wide electric guitar chords, sustained strings melody, smooth bass guitar and passionate female vocal singing over it. It sounds epic, powerful and energetic, like something you would hear in video games trailers."
