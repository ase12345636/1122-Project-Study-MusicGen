    "caption": "The low quality recording features a synth melody and a lot of synth sound effects, over which there is a funny boy vocal talking. The synth melody continues to play in the second part of the loop where shimmering bells, snaps layered with snappy rimshots and harmonizing kids' vocals singing over them, appear. It sounds happy, joyful and fun - like something kids would listen to."
