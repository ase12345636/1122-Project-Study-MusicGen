    "caption": "A digital drum is playing a simple groove with a kick on every beat. Beeping tones that seem to come from a synthesizer come in along with the snare hit. A guitar-like sound is being played, serving as bassline. A very far sounding deep voice is playing on the right side of the speakers with a lot of reverb and delay. This song may be playing in a techno club."
