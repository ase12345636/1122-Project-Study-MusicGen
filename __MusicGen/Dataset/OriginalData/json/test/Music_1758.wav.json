    "caption": "This is an ambient/electronica music piece. It is an instrumental piece. There is a granular synth playing a vague sounding melody while a warp effect enters and a piano starts playing gently. There is a nostalgic and melancholic feel to it. This piece could be playing in the soundtrack of a drama movie during a scene where the feeling of regret is emphasized."
