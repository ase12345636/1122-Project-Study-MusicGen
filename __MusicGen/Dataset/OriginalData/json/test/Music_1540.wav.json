    "caption": "The low quality recording features a jazz song being played in a big room and it consists of a saxophone solo melody over groovy drums. Due to frequency clashing, it sounds muddy and muffled and it has an unbalanced stereo image, as it was probably recorded with a poor quality microphone. It is still energetic and easygoing at the same time - thanks to that saxophone."
