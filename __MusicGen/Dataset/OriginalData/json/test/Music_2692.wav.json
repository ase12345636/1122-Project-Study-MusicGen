    "caption": "This is a very poor quality recording of an electronic music piece played in the background of a dance video. There is an irritatingly high-pitched synth playing a repetitive melody while an electronic drum beat is in the rhythmic background. If an aggressive high-end cutoff was applied, samples could be lifted from this piece to be used in a beat."
