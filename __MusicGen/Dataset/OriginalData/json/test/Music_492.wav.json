    "caption": "This is an instrumental backing track of a jazz music piece. There is no singer in this version of the piece. The piano is playing the chords in the minor key while a bass guitar can be heard playing a walking bass line. The rhythmic background consists of acoustic drums playing a jazz swing beat. The atmosphere is delicate. This piece could be playing in the background at a coffee shop. It could be used in the soundtrack of a romantic movie."
