    "caption": "The low quality recording features a cover of a blues song and it consists of subtly strummed, acoustic rhythm guitar, followed by electric guitar solo melody. It sounds passionate, easygoing and cool - like something you would hear in high end bars or blues clubs. The recording is a bit noisy."
