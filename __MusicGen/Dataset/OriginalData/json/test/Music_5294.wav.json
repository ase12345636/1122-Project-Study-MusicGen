    "caption": "This song features the main melody played on a steel pan. This is accompanied by programmed percussion with the hi-hat being played on the 'and' count of every bar. A bass plays the root notes of the chords in the background. Another percussion instrument plays a beat that sounds like a trotting horse. This song has a happy mood. This song can be played in a movie where a family is going on a holiday at a Caribbean island."
