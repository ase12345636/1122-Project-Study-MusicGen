    "caption": "The music is purely instrumental and it features a 12-string acoustic guitar playing the same note over and over. Since it's a 12-string guitar the note can be heard played twice really fast. I guess a better name would be tuning instead of melody, because it sounds as if the guitarist is trying to tune the 2 strings to play the same note together."
