    "caption": "The low quality recording features a pop song that consists of groovy piano chords, harmonizing background vocals, punchy kick and snare hits, shimmering shakers, groovy bass and muffled female vocals singing over it. It sounds energetic, happy, fun and addictive - like something you would hear on a radio."
