    "caption": "This rock song features a male voice singing the main melody. The melody has a repetitive pattern. Another voice sings 'ooh' in the background. This is accompanied by percussion playing a simple rock beat in common time. The bass plays a note and slides to the higher octave and comes back to the original note. The guitar strums the chords of this song. This song has a hippie feel. This song can be played in a movie based on a drug cartel."
