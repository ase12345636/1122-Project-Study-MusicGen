    "caption": "The low quality recording features a cover of a pop song and it consists of passionate male vocals, alongside harmonizing background vocals, singing over wide, arpeggiated electric guitar melody and simple bass guitar. The recording is a bit noisy, but it is barely audible, especially when you take into account that it sounds very emotional."
