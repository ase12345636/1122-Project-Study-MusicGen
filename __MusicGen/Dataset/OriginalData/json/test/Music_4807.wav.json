At the beginning, a scratch slide is played on the distortion guitar. The bass plays notes in groups of three on the first and second counts of each bar. A keyboard plays repetitive fills in between lines. The voice is emotive and the feel of this song is psychedelic. The audio quality is low. This song can be played in a night driving scene in a movie."
