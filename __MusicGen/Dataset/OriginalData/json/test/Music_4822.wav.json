    "caption": "This is an American folk music piece. There is a male vocal singing melodically as the lead and there is a male back vocal accompanying the lead in different harmonies. The melody is composed of a rich amalgam of chordophones such as the fiddle, the acoustic guitar, the bass guitar and the banjo. The atmosphere is easygoing but melancholic. This piece could be playing in the background at an American diner or a pub. It could also work well in the soundtrack of a movie taking place in rural USA."
