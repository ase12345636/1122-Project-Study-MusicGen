    "caption": "A digital drum is playing a techno groove with a kick on every beat. A synth bass is playing a simple line along to a piano playing major chords. Panned to the sides of the speakers you can hear a xylophone like sound playing the melody along in a higher key and a marimba adding notes. A digital brass sound is adding hits to the melody. A female voice is singing in a higher key. This song may be playing in a kids tv-show."
