    "caption": "This is the live performance of a pop music piece. It is an amateur recording. There are male vocals singing melodically. An electric guitar strums a chord for the ending of a song while the sounds of the cymbals can be heard from the acoustic drums. The cheers of the crowd can be heard even more than the music itself. This recording could be sampled for use in beat-making."
