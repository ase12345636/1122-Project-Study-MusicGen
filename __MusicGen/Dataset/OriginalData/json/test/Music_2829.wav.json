    "caption": "This song features a male voice singing the main melody. The first two lines are sung using the same melody and it culminates in the third line. This is accompanied by percussion playing a simple beat. The bass plays the root notes of the chords. The keyboard plays arpeggiated chords in the background. Another synth plays a windy pad voice throughout the song sounding like strings. This song has a holiday mood. This song can be played in a holiday movie."
