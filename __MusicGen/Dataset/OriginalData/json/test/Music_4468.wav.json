    "caption": "This song contains an acoustic drum-set holding the groove and changing his beat after a fill-in to a four on the floor with a kick on every beat. Mixed voices are singing a soulful sounding melody then an e-piano takes over playing a melody before a trumpet and a saxophone come in playing a loud melody. In the background you can hear percussion such as a cowbell being panned to the right side of the speakers. The crowd is cheering and clapping along. This song may be playing at a live concert."
