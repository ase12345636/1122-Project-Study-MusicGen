    "caption": "This is an amateur recording of a gospel music performance. There are two organs playing simultaneously, taking turns in playing groovy melodies. There is a bass guitar playing in the background. The rhythmic background consists of an acoustic drum beat that gives peak sounds due to the poor quality of the recording. There is a sophisticated feel to this piece."
