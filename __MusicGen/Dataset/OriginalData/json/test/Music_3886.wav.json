    "caption": "The low quality recording features a dark moody piano melody and at the very end of the loop, a short snippet of muffled snare hit and flat male vocals. It sounds very noisy, as there are vinyl cracklings, but also warm, suspenseful, dark and dramatic - almost like a horror movie melody theme."
