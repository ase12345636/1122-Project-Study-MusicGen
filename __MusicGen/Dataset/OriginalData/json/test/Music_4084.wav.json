    "caption": "The low quality recording features a rock song that consists of harmonizing background vocals, alongside passionate male vocals, singing over, at least, punchy snare, simple hi hats, smooth bass, thin kick and punchy snare hits. The recording is so noisy that the actual song can barely be heard, but regardless it sounds vintage, energetic and uplifting."
