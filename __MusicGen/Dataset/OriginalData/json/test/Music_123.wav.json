    "caption": "This is an amateur recording of an Afro-cuban dance music performance. There are male vocals singing joyfully. There is a percussion orchestra made up of diverse elements such as the conga, the bongo and the timbales are playing in the rhythmic background. The atmosphere is lively and vibrant. Although the audio quality is not that great, this piece can still be sampled for use in beat-making."
