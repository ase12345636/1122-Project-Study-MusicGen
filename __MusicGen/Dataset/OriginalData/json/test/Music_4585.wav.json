    "caption": "The low quality recording features a groovy didgeridoo playing over playback that consists of a \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern and shimmering hi hats, followed by snappy rimshots. There is a flat male vocal talking at one point. The recording is loud, distorted and it sounds groovy overall."
