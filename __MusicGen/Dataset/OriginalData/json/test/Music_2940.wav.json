    "caption": "This is an instrument showcase jam. Different tracks are being played to show the features of a keyboard. Initially, there is a synth pad playing. Then, an acoustic sounding drum beat and a groovy bass line starts playing in the background of a brass sounding melody. The sounds are mostly generic. Parts of this recording could be sampled to be used in advertisement jingles."
