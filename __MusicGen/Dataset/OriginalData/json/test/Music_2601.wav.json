    "caption": "A e-guitar with a chorus effect is playing a simple, repeating chord progression while another guitar  is playing a bassline over it that sounds more like a countermelody. On top of that, slightly panned to the right side of the speakers, a xylophone is playing single notes with a lot of reverb. This song sounds repetitive and relaxing and soft. This song may be playing with earphones waiting for the bus."
