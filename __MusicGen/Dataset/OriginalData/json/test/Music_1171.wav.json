    "caption": "This is a live performance of what sounds like a Middle Eastern. The female singer has a calm and soothing voice which she uses to sing vocables - or open mouthed humming. There are percussive chimes, and an acoustic guitar arpeggio which adds to the calm and soothing feel of the song."
