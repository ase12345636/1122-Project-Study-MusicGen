    "caption": "The drums are playing a steady rock groove with a half open hi hat constantly ringing through the song. The e-guitar is panned to the left and right side of the speakers or two e-guitars are shredding the same distorted chords along with the bass silently playing in the background. The female voice is singing in a higher pitch and is accompanied by a female backing voice singing a deeper harmony. This sounds like a typical high school rock song. This song may be played chilling in your room sitting on the bed daydreaming."
