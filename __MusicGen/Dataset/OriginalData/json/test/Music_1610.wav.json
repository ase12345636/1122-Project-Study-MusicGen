    "caption": "This is a live recording. We hear a set of Indian bagpipes, otherwise known as mashak, playing a complex motif. There are two singers doing open-mouthed humming in contrasting high and low pitches simultaneously. We hear the applause and cheering of a crowd as well. At the beginning, a male speaker and female speaker each make some comments in a South Asian language."
