    "caption": "An acoustic drum is playing a straight groove while an e-bass is playing a bassline that reminds of reggae. This feeling gets enhanced by a e-guitar strumming a short rhythmic chord on the offbeat giving the song its typical reggae vibe. On top of that, someone is playing a melody on a steeldrums. This song may be playing at beachbar."
