    "caption": "This song features synth sounds. There is no particular melody. There is no percussion and no voices. This sounds like sounds from outer space. When the first note is played, a ring modulated sound is played in the background. The same pattern is found in the third, fourth and fifth notes. This song can be played in a movie featuring an outer space theme."
