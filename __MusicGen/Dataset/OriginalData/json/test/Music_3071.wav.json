    "caption": "This is an instrumental percussion piece performed by an orchestra. There is a marimba playing the main melody at the forefront while bell percussion adds texture around it. There is a timpani that plays a loud drum line that is accentuated by occasional cymbal hits. The atmosphere is lighthearted. This piece would fit perfectly in the soundtrack of an arcade video game."
