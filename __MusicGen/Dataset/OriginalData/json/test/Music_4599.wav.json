    "caption": "This heavy metal song features a male voice singing the main melody. This is accompanied by aggressive percussion playing in common time. The distortion guitar plays power chords with a galloping rhythm. The gallop is ended with an ascending lick. The bass follows the same pattern as the distortion guitar but plays only the root notes of the chords. This song is upbeat. The quality of the audio is low. This song can be used when a wrestler enters the WWE arena."
