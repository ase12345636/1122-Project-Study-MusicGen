The acoustic guitar is strumming chords in the background being panned to the left side of the speaker while a e-guitar panned to the right side of the speaker is playing the lead melody strumming chords with a wah-wah pedal. A male backing voice is singing the same melody in a loop. The male lead voice is singing over the backing vocals. This song may be playing on a road trip."
