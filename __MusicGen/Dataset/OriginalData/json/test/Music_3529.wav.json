    "caption": "This is an amateur recording of a dance performance. There is a zumba dance music version of a movie theme playing in the background. The melody is being played by the strings and the keyboard while there is a loud electronic drum beat for the rhythm. There is a mysterious yet energetic feel to this piece. The recording quality is not that great. However, this piece could still be used to gather samples for beat-making."
