    "caption": "This is the live performance of a country music piece. There is a female vocal and two male vocals taking turns and sometimes singing the words at the same time. The melody consists of an electric guitar, an acoustic guitar and a bass guitar while in the rhythmic background there is an acoustic sounding upbeat drum beat. The atmosphere is cozy. There is an easygoing aura to it. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a movie or a TV show that takes place in rural USA."
