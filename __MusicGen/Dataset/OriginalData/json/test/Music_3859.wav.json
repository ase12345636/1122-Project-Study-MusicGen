    "caption": "The clip is a combination of various sound effects. First, we have a fire crackling and this continues throughout the clip. Then we have the sounds of hard objects falling on a wooden floor, and then the sound of glass breaking. What follows is a retro video game beeping sound effect, a grungy electric guitar power chord sequence, and simple rock drumming along with a bassline that matches the chords."
