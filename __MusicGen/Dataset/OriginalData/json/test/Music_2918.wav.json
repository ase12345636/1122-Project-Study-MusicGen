    "caption": "The low quality recording features a soft rock song playing over pigs oinks sound effects. The song contains a short drum break at the beginning, punchy snare, simple kick pattern, smooth bass guitar, wide acoustic rhythm guitar, shimmering cymbals and flat female vocals singing over it. Sounds like it is some kind of documentary about pigs, as the song is playing in the background."
