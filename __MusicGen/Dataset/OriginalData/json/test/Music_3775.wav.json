    "caption": "This electropop song features a female voice singing a repetitive melody. The voice seems like it is coming from a distance. This is accompanied by programmed percussion playing a disco beat. The kick is played at every count. The bass plays a funky bass line using octaves and filler notes in between. There are synth layers that are played in this song. One synth layer plays a piano-sounding loop only with chords. Another synth layer plays an ascending and descending loop according to the chords being played. This song has a happy mood and can be played in a club."
