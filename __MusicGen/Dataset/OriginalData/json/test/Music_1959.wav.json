    "caption": "The low quality recording features a soft rock song that consists of harmonizing mixed vocals singing passionately over mellow piano chords, soft synth pad chords, boomy kick and reverberant claps. It sounds boomy, muddy and dull, as the low frequencies are clashing, bu it is also emotional regardless."
