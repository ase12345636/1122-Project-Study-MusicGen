    "caption": "This is an Arabian themed instrumental music piece. The tune is played by a virtual eastern-sounding instrument while there is a virtual strings backing for the bass notes. The rhythmic background consists of a repeated percussion beat. There is an intriguing feel coming from the back-and-forth movement of the tune. The piece could be used in an eastern historical drama."
