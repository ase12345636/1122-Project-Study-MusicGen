    "caption": "The low quality recording features a R&B song that consists of passionate male vocals, alongside background harmonizing male vocals, singing over tinny bells melody, synth strings melody, tinny high pitched synth lead melody, shimmering hi hats, gliding bass, punchy kick and claps. It sounds passionate and emotional, even though the mix of the song is poor."
