    "caption": "This is an energetic and positive old school rock song. The recording is of a live performance. The singing is muffled and the instruments sound mashed together in a way that diminishes their quality. You can just barely make out an intricate electric bass bassline, an organ that's high pitched, and some enthusiastic backing vocals."
