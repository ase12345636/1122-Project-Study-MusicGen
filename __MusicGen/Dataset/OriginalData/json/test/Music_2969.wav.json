A steeldrum sample is playing a repeating melody while a male voice is rapping in a higher pitch along to backing vocals creating a cheerful atmosphere. Then the song stops and you can hear mobile phones ringing. Two male voices are talking to each other. Then the recording stops with a beeping sound. This recording may be playing in a movie scene."
