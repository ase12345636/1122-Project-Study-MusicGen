    "caption": "The low quality recording features a pop song that consists of harmonizing male vocals singing over groovy bass, shimmering cymbals, \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern, claps, addictive synth brass melody and distorted, buzzy synth lead. It sounds energetic, happy and fun - like something you would hear on TV commercials."
