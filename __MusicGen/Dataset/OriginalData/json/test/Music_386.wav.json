    "caption": "The low quality recording features an emotional electric guitar melody, shimmering hi hats, soft kick hits and punchy snare in the left channel and arpeggiated electric guitar melody and simple bass guitar in the right channel of the stereo image. Due to this unconventional panning, the stereo image sounds a bit unbalanced. It is still emotional and passionate."
