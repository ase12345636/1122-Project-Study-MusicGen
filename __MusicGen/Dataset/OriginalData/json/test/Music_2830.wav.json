    "caption": "A drum is playing a groove with a strong snare sound. An e-guitar is strumming short funky chords on the offbeat creating a reggae style rhythm. A male backing voice is shouting in the same offbeat. An e-bass is playing a soft funky bassline while a male voice sings in the mid range. A trumpet is adding a short melody on top spicing up the good vibes. This song may be playing in a car racing video-game."
