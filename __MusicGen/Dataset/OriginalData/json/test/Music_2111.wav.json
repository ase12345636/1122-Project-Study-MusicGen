    "caption": "An acoustic drum with a lot of reverb is playing a minimalistic slow groove along with an e-bass playing long single notes. A synth hit comes in for a moment and then an e-guitar is talking over it with a melody. The male voice sings with a lot of reverb, reverb and a chorus/flanger on his voice. The whole recording is full of reverb and the voice of the singer is using a ping pong delay. This song may be playing on a lazy day at home."
