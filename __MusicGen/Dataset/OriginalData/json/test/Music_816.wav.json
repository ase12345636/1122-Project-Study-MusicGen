    "caption": "This is an instrumental piece from a soap opera soundtrack. The violin and the acoustic guitar are playing a mellow tune while there is an occasional piano tune in the background. The rhythm is kept by a very quiet acoustic drum beat. The atmosphere is gentle and romantic. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of romance movies where the characters are having a good time in the presence of each other."
