    "caption": "The Alternative/Indie song cover features an acoustic ensemble that includes acoustic guitar chord progression, still guitar melody and tinny double bass playing it. It sounds narrow due to the fact that it is a mono recording. Everything, including the double bass, sounds kind of tinny and reverberant, because it was most likely recorded with one mono, room microphone. The sound could definitely be better, but it does not fall into the category of a low quality recording."
