    "caption": "This swing music is an instrumental piece. It starts off with the trumpets playing high pitched notes in harmony. The percussion starts to play with an intro roll. A wind instrument swell is played after the intro percussion roll. A wind instrument plays a repetitive lick after this followed by a piano playing chords at higher octaves in the spaces between the wind instrument licks. The bass plays the same lick on a lower octave. There are no voices in this song. This song can be played in a retro movie dance scene."
