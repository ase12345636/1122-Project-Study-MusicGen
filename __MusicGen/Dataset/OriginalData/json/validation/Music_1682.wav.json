After three bars, the female voices sing in harmony with the main voice. This is accompanied by programmed percussion playing a simple beat. The snare is played on the third count of every bar. Synth strings play an epic style melody in the background. The bass plays the root notes of the chords. A piano plays a descending run in the first bar. The mood of this song is romantic. This song can be played in a romantic movie."
