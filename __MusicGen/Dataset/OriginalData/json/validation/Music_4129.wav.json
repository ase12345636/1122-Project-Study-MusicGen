    "caption": "The low quality recording features a pop folk song that consists of passionate female vocal singing over repetitive flute licks, stuttering hi hats, groovy piano chords, claps and a riser sweep. It sounds energetic and kind of addictive, thanks to those interesting melodies and a fairly repetitive female vocal."
