    "caption": "This is a deep house piece. There is a repeating female vocal sample playing while the keyboard and bells are carrying the melody playing the same two chords repeatedly. There is also a nice sound effect. The electronic drum beat is in a crescendo movement creating a hyped-up atmosphere. A male vocal uttering a few words can be heard later on. The piece has a danceable but chill aura to it. It could be used at house parties, dance clubs and tourism advertisements."
