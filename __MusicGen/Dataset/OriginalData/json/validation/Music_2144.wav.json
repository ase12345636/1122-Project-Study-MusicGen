    "caption": "This is a live performance of an electronic dance music piece. There is a vocal sample repeating the same line. A synth is playing the tune while the electronic drums are playing the rhythm. There is a rising pattern and an energetic atmosphere. If it were not for the poor quality of the recording, this piece would fit nicely at a nightclub."
