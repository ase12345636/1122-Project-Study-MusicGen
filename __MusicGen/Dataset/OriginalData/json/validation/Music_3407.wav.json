    "caption": "This is a punk rock song with an energetic, youthful feel that is still grungy and gritty. The guitar is dark and powerful in the low tones, contrasted by another electric guitar that's bright and warm on the off beats. The drummer plays a high octane drum beat with drum fills between each line of the lyrics."
