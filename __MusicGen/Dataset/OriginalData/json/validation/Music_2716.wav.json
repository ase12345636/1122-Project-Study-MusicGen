    "caption": "This ambient song features a female voice using a delay effect so that the words are repeated. This is accompanied by a cymbal played on every beat. No other percussion is played. The bass plays the root note of the chord. There are multiple synth layers in the background. One layer of synth plays a haunting sound which sounds like a string section in the background. Another layer of synth plays a high pitched ring modulated sound toward the end of the track. This song can be used in a gym or workout video."
