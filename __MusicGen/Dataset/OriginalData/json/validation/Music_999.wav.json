    "caption": "The low quality recording features a DJ scratching his vinyl record of an electro song that consists of flat male vocals talking over \"4 on the floor\" kick, synth keys melody, groovy bass, shimmering hi hats, energetic crash cymbals and punchy snare hits. It sounds muddy and messy, since the frequencies are clashing and since it is probably recorded with a phone."
