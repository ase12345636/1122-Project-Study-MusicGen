    "caption": "Someone is playing a loud acoustic drums full of kick and low tom hits sounding wild and psychedelic along with sliding e-guitars building up tension before breaking into the next part of the song with a lot of crash hits and the guitars strumming distorted chords: The e-bass is playing along one note to create tension before breaking into a bassline that gives the song more power. The instruments are panned to the left and right side of the speakers. The female voice is singing loud and in the mid-range. This song may be playing at a festival where everybody is dancing."
