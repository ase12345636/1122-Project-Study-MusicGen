    "caption": "The low quality recording features some camera shuttering sound effects and a jazz song playing in the background. The song consists of a cool saxophone solo melody over groovy bass, easygoing electric guitar chords in the left channel of the stereo image and energetic drums. It sounds easygoing and energetic at the same time."
