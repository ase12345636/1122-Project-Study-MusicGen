    "caption": "The Soft rock song features a mellow female vocal singing the same melody as the lead electric guitar, followed by widely spread acoustic rhythm guitars, simple bass, soft kick hits, punchy snare, simple hi hats, shimmering open hats and energetic crash cymbals. There is a short snare roll at some point in the loop. The stereo bass guitar is what makes the stereo image imbalance and therefore the song sounds lower in quality."
