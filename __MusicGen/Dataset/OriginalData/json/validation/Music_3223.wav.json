    "caption": "This is a parody montage of a K-pop music piece. There is a girl band singing in the original track. On the parts where the girls are hollering, the sounds of goats bleating were added. The original track has a keyboard playing the melody while there is a strong bass in the background. The rhythm is played by the electronic drums. There is an amusing atmosphere."
