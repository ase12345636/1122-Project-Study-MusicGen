    "caption": "This is an upbeat pop dance song in Spanish. The drum beat is energetic and punchy and features hi-hat hits in eighth notes throughout the clip. There's a male vocalist chanting the same phrase energetically, while the female singer calmly and coolly sings a gentle melody. The female singer's melody almost stands in contrast to the very lively beat."
