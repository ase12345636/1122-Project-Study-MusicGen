    "caption": "This is an indie rap/hip-hop music piece. There is male voice rapping rapidly over a beat. The beat has a plucked strings sample for the melody. The rhythmic background is a normal tempo hip-hop beat played on the acoustic drums. There is also a speech sample used in the beat. The atmosphere is groovy and crisp. This piece would fit perfectly in the soundtrack of a crime movie/TV series that takes place in the big city. It could also be used in the soundtrack of a crime/shootout video game. It could be playing at sports venues as well."
