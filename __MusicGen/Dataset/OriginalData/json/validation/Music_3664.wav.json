    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a pop song and it consists of a passionate boy vocal singing over wide synth melody, reversed crash riser, punchy kick and snare hits, shimmering hi hats, groovy synth bass and later sustained synth bass. There is some crowd noise and cheering sounds. It sounds addictive, energetic and exciting."
