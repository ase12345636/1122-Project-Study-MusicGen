    "caption": "A male voice is singing a melody in the midrange sounding like having fun while doing so. Backing vocals are shouting at the end of his phrase. In the background you can hear the instruments playing funky melodies; rhythms and grooves. What stands out is a flute playing a flute melody sounding like a traditional chinese melody and digital strings are playing in the midrange. This song may be playing celebrating graduation with costumes."
