    "caption": "This song has a bassline that repeats itself playing along with a distorted guitar that supports the melody by playing the low notes along with slight variations and licks. The acoustic drums sound in the background but are played at full force. Fast paced with a lot of hits on different crashes and using a double bass kick. The male voice is screaming full force then a synthesizer lead sound is playing a simple melody that is panned to the right side of the speakers. This song may be playing at a live-concert jumping up and down enjoying the energetic energy of the surrounding and the music."
