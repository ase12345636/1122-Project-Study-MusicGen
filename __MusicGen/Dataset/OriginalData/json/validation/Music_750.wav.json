    "caption": "A lot of male voices are chanting a mantra. Their voices reach from the low register up to the mid range. A drone pad sound is panned to the right side of the speakers along with a pluck playing single notes on top. The voices are also spread along the speakers and the whole recording is full of big reverb and a little bit of reverb. This song may be played while meditating or in an epic, heroic movie scene."
