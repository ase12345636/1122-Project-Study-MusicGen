    "caption": "The Hip Hop/Rap song features a flat male vocal with filtered, background male vocals, rapping over repetitive plucked synth melody and addictive synth lead melody, followed by distorted 808 bass, snaps and some offbeat hi hats. The whole sound is distorted and everything is in mono, which makes the song low quality."
