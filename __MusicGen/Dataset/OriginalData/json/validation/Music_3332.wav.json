    "caption": "The low quality recording features a rock song and it consists of harmonizing male vocals singing over groovy bass, punchy drums and electric guitar melody. It sounds completely crushed, muffled and messy, since the frequencies of the instruments are clashing with each other. Regardless, it still sounds energetic."
