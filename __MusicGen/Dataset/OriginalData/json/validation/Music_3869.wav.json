    "caption": "This composition contains acoustic drums playing a complex groove on just the snare using brushes. The crowd in the background is cheering, whistling and clapping their hands. A bass, piano and horn section is playing a melody as a counter-beat along with trumpets playing along a modified melody in a higher register. Then saxophones are coming in playing their own countermelody. This song is highly complex and may be playing at a jazz festival."
