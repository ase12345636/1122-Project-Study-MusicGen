    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a regional Mexican song and it consists of passionate male vocal singing over groovy bass guitar, mellow synth keys melody and electric guitar melody, followed by shimmering tambourine, hi hats and punchy kick. It sounds passionate, emotional and soulful - like something you would hear at family gathering events."
