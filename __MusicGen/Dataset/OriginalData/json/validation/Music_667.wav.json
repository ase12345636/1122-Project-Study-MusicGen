    "caption": "A digital drum with a strong snare that sounds like a slap is playing along with an e-bass that is being slapped, playing a funky bassline. A e-guitar is strumming two funky chords along. A female voice is rapping with a lot of confidence in the attitude and then another female voice is singing accompanied by female backing voices. The file is of poorer audio-quality. This song may be playing in a disco."
