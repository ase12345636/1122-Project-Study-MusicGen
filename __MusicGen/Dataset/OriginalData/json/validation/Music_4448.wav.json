    "caption": "The music excerpt features a male voice that's speaking instead of singing. A latin music percussion section is driving the pulse of the music. Trumpets can be heard playing short melodies and also accents that stop and start the music. The tempo of the music is pretty fast. At one point the crowd can be heard cheering. The quality of the audio recording is not that good, which leads me to believe it was recorded with a phone."
