    "caption": "The music features a male voice singing a descending melody that repeats. The instrumental consists of a drum kit that's playing a light rhythm, a double bass that's playing a repeating descending melody and an electric guitar that's strumming chords once per beat. The quality of the audio recording is not so good which leads me to believe this is an amateur recording and not something professional."
