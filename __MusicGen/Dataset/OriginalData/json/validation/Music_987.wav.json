    "caption": "This is a funky disco song. A song like this would be suitable for an eighties themed dance party. It has a groovy bassline, upbeat rhythmic percussion, and vibrant brass motifs. The singer sounds charming and energetic. The background singers are soulful and sharp on the beat with their vocals - they sing their notes almost in staccato, so that they can stay close to the beat and keep the song feeling groovy."
