    "caption": "This is a Croatian pop music piece. There is a male vocalist singing melodically in the lead. The acoustic guitar is playing a simple tune with the bass guitar playing in the background. The rhythm is played by a basic electronic drum beat with an acoustic sound. There is a lively atmosphere to this piece. This piece could fit well in the soundtrack of a romantic comedy movie that takes place in Croatia."
