    "caption": "This is a rocksteady music piece. There is a male vocalist with a Jamaican accent singing in a relaxed manner. The melody is being played by an electric guitar and a keyboard with a groovy bass guitar joining them in the background. The acoustic drums are playing a slow tempo reggae beat in the rhythmic background. The atmosphere is chill and tropical. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a romance movie with a tropical setting. It could also be playing in the background at a beach or a seaside restaurant."
