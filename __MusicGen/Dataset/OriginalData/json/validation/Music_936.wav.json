    "caption": "A digital drum is playing a four on the floor groove with a kick on every beat and a noisy sounding snare. A synth bass sound is playing a bassline along with a sub bass. On top of that a synth pluck sound is playing a fast arpeggiated melody. A noise sound is used as an atmospheric element. This song may be playing in an arcade video-game."
