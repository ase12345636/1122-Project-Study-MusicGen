    "caption": "The low quality recording features a regional Mexican song that consists of a reverberant male vocal singing over widely spread groovy piano chord progression, brass section, shimmering shakers, groovy percussive elements and smooth bass. It sounds tropical, exotic and fun, like something you would hear at latin weddings."
