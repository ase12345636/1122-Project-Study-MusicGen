There is an acoustic guitar playing the main tune with a bass guitar holding the root notes in the background. The rhythmic structure is composed of acoustic sounding drums and percussion playing a syncopated beat. There is a feeling of hope in this piece. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of an inspiring movie/TV show. It could also be played at sports venues."
