    "caption": "This country song features a male voice singing the main melody. This is accompanied by percussion playing a simple country beat in common time. A pedal steel guitar plays sliding notes as fills in between lines. The bass plays the root note and the lower fifth of the chords being played. The other instruments are not audible as the audio quality is low. This song can be played in a square dancing party."
