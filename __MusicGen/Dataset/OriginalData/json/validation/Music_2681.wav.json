    "caption": "Someone is playing an acoustic drum groove with a snare that uses reverb. An e-bass is playing a sub bassline. An e-guitar is strumming short rhythmic chords on the backbeat giving this music its reggae vibe. A keyboard is playing a sound in the mid range and another keyboard responds with a countermelody playing a melody using a brass sound. In the background you can hear people talking. This song may be playing live at a festival."
