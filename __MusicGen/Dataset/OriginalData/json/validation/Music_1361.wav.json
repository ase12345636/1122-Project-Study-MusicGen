    "caption": "The low quality recording features a sound from a video game that consists of some footsteps sound effects and a wide mellow synth pad progression playing in the background. The synth pad volume ducks every time there is a synth bell melody, followed by synth bell sound effects. Sounds like a game with loud interactive gameplay sounds."
