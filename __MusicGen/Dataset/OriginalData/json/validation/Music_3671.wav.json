    "caption": "This is a rock-n-roll music piece. There is a male vocalist in the lead singing in a gritty manner. The electric guitar is playing a simple tune with the backing of the bass guitar. The rhythmic background consists of a basic upbeat acoustic rock drum beat. There is a groovy feel to this piece. It could be playing in the background at a rock bar. It could also be used in the soundtrack of a feelgood movie during road trip scenes."
