    "caption": "The drums sound complex and fast paced  going into the direction of drum&bass. Full of hihat and snare hits. Barely noticeable a synthetic bass is playing along with the drums giving this song a ragga feeling. A very simple synthesizer pad is playing a high pitched melody. The male voice sounds lower and energetic. This recording is of poor audio quality. This song may be playing at a dancing event or while working out."
