    "caption": "A Latin club track with a thumping bass and a funky feel. The kick snare pattern is simple and the hi-hat is busy playing steady 16th notes. Distorted electric guitar plays a lead melody along with the autotuned harmonized male background vocals. The lead vocals feature a male and female duo singing in harmony, while synth strings fill in the beat with short chords."
