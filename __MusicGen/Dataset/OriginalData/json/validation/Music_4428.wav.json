    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance that consists of shimmering shakers, wooden percussion, breathy flute melody and passionate female vocals singing over it. It sounds very addictive, due to the lead vocal cadence. It is a bit reverberant, as it was recorded in a larger room, with a low quality microphone."
