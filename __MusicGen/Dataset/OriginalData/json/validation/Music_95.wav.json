    "caption": "The low quality recording features a classical live performance of sustained violin melody, shimmering hi hats, electric guitar melody, theremin solo melody and subtle female vocals at the end of the loop. There are some crowd clapping sounds in the background. It is noisy, in mono and it sounds passionate and emotional."
