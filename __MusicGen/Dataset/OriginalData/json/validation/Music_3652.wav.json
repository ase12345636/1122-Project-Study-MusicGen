    "caption": "This is an Armenian pop music ballad piece. The male vocalist is singing in a sentimental manner. The melody is being played by the piano and the strings section while the bass guitar plays a simple bass line composed of root notes. The rhythmic background is provided by a 6/8 slow tempo acoustic drum beat. The atmosphere is romantic. This piece would fit perfectly in an Armenian wedding. It could also be included in the soundtrack of a romance movie that takes place in Armenia."
