    "caption": "An acoustic piano is playing a melody along with a flute-sound and an acoustic guitar picking two notes repeatedly. Then the song breaks softly into a new part as the acoustic guitar and piano are fading out. In the background you can hear some insects chirping. Now an electric piano sound is playing a melody along with a male voice singing. His voice sounds sensitive.  This song may be playing for a movie scene."
