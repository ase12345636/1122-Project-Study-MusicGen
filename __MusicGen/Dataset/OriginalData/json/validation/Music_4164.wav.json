    "caption": "This song contains a male voice repeating itself before continuing  with its melody. It sounds like running through a sampler along with an electric drum that seems to be programmed, repeating itself with a kick, snare and a very sharp sounding industrial hihat/ride sound. This recording is of poor sound-quality and may be playing at home building a song."
