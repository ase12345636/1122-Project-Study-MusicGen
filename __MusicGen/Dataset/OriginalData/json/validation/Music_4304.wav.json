    "caption": "The Electro song features a punchy \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern perfectly complemented by groovy bass, followed by tinny laser percussive sound effects, shimmering cymbals, claps and echoing pulsating synth lead melody. Sounds energetic, a bit addictive thanks to that synth lead and something like you would hear in electronic dance music clubs."
