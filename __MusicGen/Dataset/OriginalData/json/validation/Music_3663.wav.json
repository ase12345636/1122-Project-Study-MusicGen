    "caption": "This is an amateur recording of a Bavarian folk music performance. The audio quality is not that great. There is a male vocalist singing in the lead. Then, brass elements start playing a cheerful tune. There is a festive atmosphere in this recording. It could be playing in the background at an Oktoberfest event."
