    "caption": "An acoustic guitar almost fully panned to the left side of the speakers is strumming a single chord as a rhythmic element while an upright-bass is playing a walking bassline. The other acoustic guitar is adding a little melody at the end of the phrase of the singers. The female duo is singing a melody together. One a little deeper and the other a little higher creating a harmony. This song may be playing in the countryside of a Latin country."
