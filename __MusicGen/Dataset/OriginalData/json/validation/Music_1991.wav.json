    "caption": "The low quality recording features a metal song that consists of wide aggressive, distorted electric guitars, distorted bass, clean electric guitar solo melody, energetic crash cymbals, punchy snare, double pedal kick and throaty male vocal talking and screaming over it. There are some energetic snare rolls that serve as a breakbeat and transition to the next section. It sounds energetic, aggressive and manic. Putting the vocal so low in the mix, makes it a low quality sound."
