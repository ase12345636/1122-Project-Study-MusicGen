    "caption": "A male vocalist sings this energetic song. The tempo is fast with enthusiastic drumming , rhythmic electric and keyboard harmony. The song is muffled because of poor audio quality and several sounds that are superimposed on it. There are sounds of water, static, bubbles, scuffling and a female voice speaking. The song is incoherent but from what can be heard it sounds like Pop Rock."
