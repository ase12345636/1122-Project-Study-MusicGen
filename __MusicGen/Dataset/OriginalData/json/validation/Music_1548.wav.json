    "caption": "The low quality recording features a sound from a video game that consists of sea sound effects, seagull sound effects, ping pong sound effects and weird, short, pitch bend riser sounds. In the beginning of the loop, there is a short snippet of some music playing in the background. The instrumental consists only of drums - wide kick hits, shimmering cymbals and some manic snare hits. There is a short echoing effect on drums that serves as a transition to the in-game sounds."
