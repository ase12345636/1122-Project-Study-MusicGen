    "caption": "This is a documentary music piece. There is a strings section that is holding a single chord. The bass guitar is repeating an ominous bass line. There is a simple percussion beat in the rhythmic background. The atmosphere has a dramatic feel to it. It feels like a story is about to unfold. The piece suits perfectly as a documentary music piece. It could also fit well in the soundtrack of a mystery movie."
