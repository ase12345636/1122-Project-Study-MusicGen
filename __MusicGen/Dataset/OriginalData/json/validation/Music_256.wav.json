    "caption": "This is a remix of an R&B soul piece. There is a male vocal singing in a laid-back manner joined by an auto-tuned male vocal. The keyboard provides the melody with a gentle bass guitar playing in the background. The rhythmic structure is composed of the acoustic drums and the percussion playing a medium tempo beat. The atmosphere of the piece is groovy and there is a feelgood aura to it. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a sitcom."
