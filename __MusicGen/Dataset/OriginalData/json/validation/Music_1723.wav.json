    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance that consists of harmonizing mixed vocals singing over distorted bass and arpeggiated synth keys melody. It sounds crushed, harsh and the stereo image is unbalanced since the sound is leaning towards the right channel of the stereo image. There are some crowd excitement sounds in the background."
