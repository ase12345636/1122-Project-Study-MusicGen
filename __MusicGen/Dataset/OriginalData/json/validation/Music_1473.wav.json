    "caption": "The drums are just playing the hihat and the kick on the second beat which is typical for reggae. The  keys are playing one chord on the offbeat. A guitar is playing some repeating chords along while the bass is playing a simple rhythmic pattern to support the drums. The female voice is singing with some reverb on her voice. This song may be playing on a sunny day at home with open windows mixed with the noises of a lovely small town."
