    "caption": "The song is an instrumental. The tempo is  medium with a percussive Arabic percussion groove, tambourine percussions, percussive bass line and a ethnic wind instrument playing an enthusiastic solo. The song has folk music influences and reminds us of a desert journey. The song audio quality is very poor."
