It starts off with 6 seconds of silence, after which a white noise can be heard, followed by three notes played in the lower register of a marimba. All this leads me to believe that the three notes we heard have a jingle-like purpose before a TV show starts. You would also hear something similar when an elevator reaches a particular floor."
