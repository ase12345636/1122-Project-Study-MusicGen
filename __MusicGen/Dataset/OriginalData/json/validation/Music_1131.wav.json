    "caption": "A male voice is singing in the mid-range with a lot of vibrato on some notes along with a shrutibox playing one chord. Here and there you can hear some hits of a tabla. The recording is full of voices talking in the background. This seems to be an amateur recording. This song may be playing at a concert with people sitting in chairs."
