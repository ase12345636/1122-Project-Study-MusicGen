    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a folk song that contains an accordion melody playing over acoustic rhythm guitar, groovy bass, punchy kick and snare hits, shimmering cymbals, saxophone and trumpet melody. It sounds passionate and easygoing, even though the recording is noisy and the stereo image is unbalanced, due to the fact that the sound is leaning towards the left channel."
