There is a keyboard and an electric guitar playing the main tune with the backing of a bass guitar. In the rhythmic background, there is an acoustic reggae drum beat. The atmosphere is groovy and chill. This piece could be playing in the background at a beach. It could also be included in the soundtrack of a summer/vacation/tropical themed movie."
