    "caption": "The low quality recording features widely spread electric guitar melodies. One of the melodies is solo and it is panned to the right channel, while the other one is an arpeggiated electric guitar melody, and it is panned to the left channel of the stereo image. The recording is a bit noisy and weird, since it is a bit too wide, but it also sounds passionate."
