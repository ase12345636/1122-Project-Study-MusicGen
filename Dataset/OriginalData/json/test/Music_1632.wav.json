    "caption": "This is a marching band piece performed by an orchestra. There are trumpets playing the main theme while tuba and cello are playing the bass notes. There is also a constant string part holding the root notes of the melody. The snare drums are playing an accentuated, militaristic drum line. There is an epic atmosphere that gives a call-to-action feeling. This piece could be used in the soundtracks of action movies and war movies in particular. It could also be used in the soundtracks of video games from the action and first-person-shootout genres."
