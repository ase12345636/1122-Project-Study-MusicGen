    "caption": "This is a bluegrass cover of an originally heavy metal music piece. There is a male vocalist singing melodically in the lead. The tune is being played by the banjo, the mandolin and the acoustic guitar while the bass guitar is playing in the background. The atmosphere is playful and there is a rural feel to the piece. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a comedy movie that takes place in the rural parts of the USA."
