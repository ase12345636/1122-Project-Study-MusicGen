    "caption": "This is a jingle piece in the background of a toy advertisement. The toy is a cash register toy, so there are a lot of beeping sounds. There is a synth playing the main tune that is constantly rising up to a higher note while a piano is playing staccato chords alongside it. A cymbal-heavy electronic drum beat can be heard. The atmosphere is uneasy. Samples could be lifted from this track to be used in beat-making or in the soundtrack of a horror movie."
