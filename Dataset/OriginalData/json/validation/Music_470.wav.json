    "caption": "This is a grunge rock music piece. A distorted electric guitar playing power chords leads the tune with a bass guitar in the background. Loud acoustic drums provide the rhythmic background while also playing a lot of fills. There is also a male vocal. The music has a rebellious atmosphere mixed with a rough sound that is characteristic of the grunge scene. This piece could be used as a soundtrack in college drama movies/TV series. It could also be used in advertisements targeted at teenagers."
