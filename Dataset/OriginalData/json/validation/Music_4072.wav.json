    "caption": "This is an amateur recording of a guitar solo for a rock music piece. The solo is being played on an overdriven electric guitar while the piano and the bass guitar in the backing track play the main tune. There is a 6/8 rock beat played on the acoustic drums for the rhythm section. There is a raw feel to it. The piece can be used to gather electric guitar samples to be used in beat-making."
