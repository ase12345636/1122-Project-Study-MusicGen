    "caption": "The music features a melody-less section, just the accompaniment. A piano is playing chords at the beginning of every measure. The kick drum plays on beats one and three and the snare drum, which seems to have some beads on its membrane, on beats two and four. An electronic sound is playing the same harmonies that the piano is playing. Two distorted sounds can be heard in the background, one of them most probably coming from an electric guitar and the other from a synth bass."
