    "caption": "The low quality recording features an alternative/indie song that consists of monotone male vocal singing over fat snare, energetic cymbals, energetic wide synth bass, punchy kick, reverberant synth bells melody and high pitched vocals. The instrumental is a bit pulsating as the kick comes in - almost like it was sidechained to it. It sounds energetic and sad."
