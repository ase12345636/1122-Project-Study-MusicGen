    "caption": "This is an instrumental electric guitar jam meant to showcase an echo delay pedal. The guitar using the pedal is merely strumming the chords while there is another electric guitar in the background playing the melody. There is also a bass guitar playing a simple bass line. In the rhythmic background there is a chill rock beat played by the acoustic drums. There is a calm and chill atmosphere in this piece. It could be used as the loading screen music in a video game."
