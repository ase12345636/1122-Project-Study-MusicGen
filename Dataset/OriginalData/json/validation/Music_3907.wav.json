    "caption": "The low quality recording features a sustained string melody, tinny shimmering bells and addictive piano melody, complementing each other. At the very end of the loop there is a short snippet of flat female vocal narrating. At some point during the loop, there is a subtle unwanted low frequency sputter, which definitely makes this recording low quality."
