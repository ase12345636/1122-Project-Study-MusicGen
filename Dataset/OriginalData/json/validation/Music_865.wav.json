    "caption": "The low quality recording features a steel drum solo melody over playback instrumental of urban latin song that consists of groovy synth bass, wide brass melody, sizzling synths, syncopated snare and punchy \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern. It sounds addictive, passionate and upbeat. The steel drum is reverberant due to the fact that it was recorded in a medium size room."
