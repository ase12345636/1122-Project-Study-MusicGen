    "caption": "This is an industrial metal/alternative metal music piece. There is a male vocal singing in a harsh manner using the guttural technique. The melody is being played by the keyboard and the distorted electric guitar while the bass guitar is playing in the background. The acoustic drums are playing a loud and fast-paced metal beat with heavy use of twin pedals on the kick drum. The atmosphere is violent. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a gruesome horror video game."
