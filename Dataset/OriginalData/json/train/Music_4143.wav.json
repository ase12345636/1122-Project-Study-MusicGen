    "caption": "The salsa music features a melody being played by an electric guitar in unison with another instrument like flute or clarinet. The percussion is latin specific and drives the pulse of the music forward. A bass guitar alternates between playing the melody in unison with the electric guitar and playing something different. At the end of the music excerpt a brass section can be heard playing a short accentuated melody."
