    "caption": "This is a lullaby in the style of Chinese traditional music. It is an instrumental piece. The qin is playing the main tune while the erhu is holding notes in the background. The occasional higher end strum of the guzheng can be heard. The atmosphere is calming and relaxing. This piece would fit perfectly in the background of a meditation video. It could also be included in the playlists that are meant to induce sleep in babies."
