    "caption": "The low quality recording features a song that consists of pitch bend horn siren melody played over groovy piano chords, groovy bass, \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern, punchy snare and simple hi hats. At the end of the loop there is a short snare roll. The siren is very loud, and over time it sounds a bit uncomfortable, but it sounds fun and happy regardless - like something that kids would listen to."
