    "caption": "The electro song features a speeding up, widely spread, synth lead, white noise riser and punchy snare going from left to the right channel in the stereo image. At the very beginning there is a short snippet of a bit more energetic part which contains \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern, synth pad chords and addictive synth lead. Overall it sounds energetic and exciting."
