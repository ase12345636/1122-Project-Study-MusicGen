    "caption": "This is an electronic music piece with 80s disco characteristics. There is a slightly fast tempo electronic drums in the rhythmic background. The keyboard is holding the notes of the melody while a synth bass follows it with a repeated rhythmic pattern. Although it is a bit old-fashioned, it is a danceable piece. This music could work well with retro-themed parties at nightclubs. It could also fit nicely with action-filled social media content or the soundtrack of a car racing game."
