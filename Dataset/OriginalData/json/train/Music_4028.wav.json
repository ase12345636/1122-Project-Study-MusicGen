    "caption": "This song is full of reverb and delay in the beginning. A riser effect is rising up to break into the next part of the song. Then a digital drum with kick and snare comes in along with a monotone bassline. A synthesizer is playing a rhythmic, very simple and monotone melody on top. The sound-elements are all panning from left to right with a ping pong delay."
