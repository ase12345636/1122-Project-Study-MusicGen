    "caption": "This is a contemporary classical music piece. It is an instrumental piece. There is a strings section playing the chords while the violin in the lead is playing a dramatic tune. The piano is playing accentuated notes. There is a percussion line in the rhythmic background. There is a dramatic atmosphere that is full of suspense. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a sci-fi drama movie, especially during the scenes where a big revelation is about to take place."
