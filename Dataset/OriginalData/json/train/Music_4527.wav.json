    "caption": "This jazz song features the main melody played on a flugelhorn and a saxophone. Both instruments play in harmony with variations in melody. These instruments compliment each other. This is accompanied by percussion playing a jazz beat with constant strokes on the ride cymbal. The bass guitar plays a groovy bassline starting with a descending lick. This is then followed with an ascending lick to reach the higher notes before descending back. The guitar plays chords with string muting in a jazz rhythm.  The mood of this song is upbeat. This song can be played in an advertisement for a luxury car."
