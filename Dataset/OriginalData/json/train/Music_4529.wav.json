    "caption": "The song is a pop band instrumental groove for an amateur home video recording. The song is medium tempo with a steady drumming rhythm, guitar lead, cowbell percussion, a percussive bass line and grunge keyboard harmony tones. The song is exciting and unimpressive like a background music track for an amateur skater video. The song is a mix of a retro pop instrumental and ambient Street noises."
