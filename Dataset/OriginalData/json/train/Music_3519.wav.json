    "caption": "The low quality recording features a groovy bass guitar, punchy \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern and tinny percussion. In the second half of the loop the music cuts out and there is a short silence, after which comes the wide, muffled sound effects. At the very end, there is a slow riser, bringing the energy up."
