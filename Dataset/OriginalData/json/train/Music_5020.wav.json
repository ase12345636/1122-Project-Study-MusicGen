    "caption": "This is an electronic music jam using a drum machine. The touchpads on the drum machine are used to perform chopped-up melodic pad sounds by tapping on them. Since this is an amateur recording, the finger tapping sounds can be heard as well. This piece could be used to lift low-resolution samples from to use in beat-making."
