    "caption": "A voice sample is ringing out with a lot of reverb. A synth pad is underlining an acoustic piano being played with a lot of reverb and delay creating an arpeggio. A guitar is playing another melody also with a lot of reverb and delay creating a ping pong effect on both sides of the speakers. There is another pulsating little synth sound being played in a higher key. This song may be playing at home relaxing and daydreaming."
