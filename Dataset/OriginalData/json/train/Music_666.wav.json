    "caption": "Here we get to hear a hardcore metal piece. This is characterised, in part, by the rapid action on the kick drum - with notes being played at a rate of sixteenth notes on the kick. The drummer also frequents the ride cymbal. The guitar is grungy, gritty, fuzzy, heavy, deep, hardcore."
