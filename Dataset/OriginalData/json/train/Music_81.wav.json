    "caption": "The low quality recording features a pop song that consists of an echoing male vocal singing over punchy kick and snare hits, shimmering hi hats, metallic percussions, synth lead melody, synth pad chords and groovy synth bass. It sounds energetic, nostalgic and exciting - like something you would hear in clubs during the 80s."
