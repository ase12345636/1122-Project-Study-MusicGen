    "caption": "Someone is playing a melody on an electric organ in a minor key. An acoustic drum is playing a simple groove with single hits on the ride. An e-bass is playing the root note of the melody accompanied by a clean e-guitar sound fingerpicking the chords. Then a deeper male voice starts singing. This song may be playing in a sad romantic movie scene."
