    "caption": "The Corporate instrumental contains wide plucked strings, simple bells, punchy, roomy kick hits and soft rimshots. At the very end of the video there is a shimmering tambourine. Judging by the silence at the end, it could be said that this is an outro of the jingle. It sounds happy, fun and uplifting, like any corporate sound should sound like."
