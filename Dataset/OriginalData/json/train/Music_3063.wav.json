    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a rock song that consists of aggressive electric guitar chord progression, punchy snare, simple kick pattern, shimmering hi hats, energetic crash cymbal and a groovy bass guitar. At the very beginning the sound is gated, leaving only the distant, reverberant guitar chords and punchy snare hits audible. There is also a short snare roll, right before the drop. This instrumental is very energetic and exciting."
