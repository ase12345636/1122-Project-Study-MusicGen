    "caption": "This audio contains acoustic drums playing a groove with a lot of cymbal hits. An e-bass is holding the groove while a distorted e-guitar is playing a solo in a higher register. In the background you can hear another e-guitar playing something like an arpeggio melody in the mid-range. This song may be playing in the rehearsal band room practicing drumming to a backing song."
