    "caption": "This composition contains a horn playing a melody with reverb on it. Then a string section comes in playing a soothing melody rising and falling in pitch. You can hear some digital clicking sounds that seem not to belong to the musical composition. This song may be playing in a fantasy adventure video-game."
