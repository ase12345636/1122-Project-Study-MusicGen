    "caption": "This is the live recording of a DJ performance. The DJ is modifying a hip-hop beat with the use of a turntable through the scratching technique. A repeated sitar sample can be heard in the beat. There is a strong and groovy bass line in the background. The rhythmic structure consists of a slightly fast-paced hip-hop electronic drum beat. There is a modern sounding, urban feel to it. This piece could be playing in the background at a sportswear shop. It could also be played at sports venues."
