    "caption": "Thissong contains two acoustic guitars panned to both sides of the speakers finger picking a repeating melody. In the background a synth pad/drone is playing a continuous chord in the mid- to high range. A female voice is adding a vocal melody in a higher register along with different flute sounds repeating the same melody. The elements are spread across the sides of the speakers. A shaker is holding the rhythmic part with reverb. This song may be playing for a slow ecstatic dance."
