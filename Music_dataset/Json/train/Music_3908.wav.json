The tempo is fast with a lively piano accompaniment, accordion harmony, cello rhythm, hard hitting drums, groovy bass lines, hand percussion beats and xylophone. The music is upbeat, energetic,enthusiastic, high-spirited and vivacious. This is a live performance with ambient sounds of people talking and general bustling. The audio quality is inferior. This song is a live Pop."
