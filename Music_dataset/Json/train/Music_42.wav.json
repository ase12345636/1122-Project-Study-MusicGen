    "caption": "This is a Christmas music piece with heavy influences from Celtic music. There is a female vocalist singing melodically as the lead. The melodic background is provided by the strings and the piano and at the same time Celtic instruments that resemble a harp and a dulcimer. There is a calming and positive aura to this piece. It could be playing in the background at a Christmas party. It could also be used in Christmas-themed shows or social media content."
