    "caption": "This song features a female voice crooning the main melody. She is using vocables and no lyrics. The same melody is played on the synth immediately after she sings the first first line. A percussion player plays a simple beat. A tambourine plays in the background. The rest of the instruments are not clear due to the low audio quality. This song can be played in a coffee shop. The mood of this song is romantic."
