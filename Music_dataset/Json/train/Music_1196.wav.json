    "caption": "This is the live recording of an alternative metal piece. There is a male vocal screaming every now and then. There is a heavy use of electronic elements which makes up for the majority of the melodic structure. There is a distorted electric guitar and a bass guitar playing. The rhythmic background consists of an aggressive acoustic metal drum playing in synchrony with the electronic elements. The atmosphere is energetic and violent. This piece could be playing in the background at a metal bar."
