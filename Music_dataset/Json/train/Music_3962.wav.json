    "caption": "This is the live performance of a sarcastic lullaby. Although the piece is written as if it is a lullaby, the words are about illegal alcohol production. The male vocalist in the lead is singing melodically in the style of a cabaret. There is a grand piano playing an accompanying tune in the background. The atmosphere is comedic. This piece could be playing at a radio station in a movie/TV show for a hidden comedic effect."
