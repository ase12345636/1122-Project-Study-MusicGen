    "caption": "This instrumental contains a digital piano playing a beautiful melody that sounds a little bit like standing in the rain on a summer day. The electronic drums sound without dynamics but with a strong kick that gets supported by the bassline. A snare hit stands in the foreground. A hi-hat fills the space in between and gets surrounded by stringsounds playing a minimalist melody with a lot of reverb on it. A short snappy pluck sound is also playing a melody. barely noticeable. This song may be playing in a chapter of a video game."
