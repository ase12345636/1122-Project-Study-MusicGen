    "caption": "This song contains a simple acoustic drum groove with a cowbell sound. Two e-guitars and an e-bass are all playing the same melody spread across the speakers. Another e-guitar is strumming dissonant chords in the background panned to the left side of the speakers. Male voices are singing in a higher key. This song may be playing while cooking with joy."
