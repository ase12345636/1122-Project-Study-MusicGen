    "caption": "This jazz song features the main melody played on the piano. The double bass plays jazz basslines using half note intervals and jazz fills. The percussion plays a complicated jazz rhythm mostly focusing on the snare hits. Another percussion is played using sticks sounding like a congo. A male voice speaks some meaningless phrase. This song can be played in a bar."
