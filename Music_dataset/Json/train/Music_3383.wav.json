    "caption": "This is an analog sounding electronic jam. The automated melody is played by a sequencer that has a synthesizer base. The electronic drums in the rhythmic background have a 909-like sound. The atmosphere of the piece is very robotic and computer-like. This piece could be used in the soundtracks of movies and video games that have a cyberpunk/futuristic sci-fi theme."
