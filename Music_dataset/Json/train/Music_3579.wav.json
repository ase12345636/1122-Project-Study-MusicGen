    "caption": "This is a funk remix of a hip-hop music piece. There is a male vocal rapping calmly almost as if he is just having a normal conversation with someone. There are various layers of different synths playing different melodies. The piece has a strong bass sound. The rhythm is being played by a groovy electronic drum beat. The atmosphere of the piece is danceable and the sound is urban. This piece could be playing at a retro-themed party at a nightclub."
