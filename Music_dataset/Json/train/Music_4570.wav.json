    "caption": "This slow jazz song features a sliding melody played on the trombone. The accordion plays chords. The piano plays a repetitive lick in the background on the high registers. The contrabass plays the root notes of the chords and also plays percussion by striking the body of the instrument. After one bar, the instruments pause for two counts. After that, the accordion resumes playing. There are no voices in this song. This is an instrumental song. This song is seductive. This song can be played in a movie scene where a man is trying to seduce a woman at a bar."
