    "caption": "This slow rock song starts off with a male voice that pauses after one word. This is accompanied by percussion playing a marching beat. Synth strings play chords in the background. Bass notes follow the root notes of the chords. After the voice pauses, a repetitive melody is played on the synth and the chords change on the other instruments. The percussion continues to play the marching beat. This song can be played in a war scene in a movie."
