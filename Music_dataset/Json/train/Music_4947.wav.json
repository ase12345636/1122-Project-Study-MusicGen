The bass plays the root notes of the chords with a run to reach the next note. There are different synth layers playing different melodies within the scale to produce a complex melody. The voice starts to sing a romantic melody. This is accompanied by the percussion playing a minimalistic beat. The synth pads play a sustained chord in the background. The bass note is sustained through the line being sung. This song can be played in a romantic movie."
