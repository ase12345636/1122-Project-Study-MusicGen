    "caption": "This low quality recording features a male voice singing the main melody. This is accompanied by percussion playing a simple beat. After two bars, the percussion plays only the ride cymbal. A distortion guitar plays power chords and after two bars, lets the last chord ring. The bass plays the root notes of the chords. This song can be played in a Transformers style movie."
