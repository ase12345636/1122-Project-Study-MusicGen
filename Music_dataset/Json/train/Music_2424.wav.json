    "caption": "The low quality recording features a DJ scratching the vinyl of a hip hop song that consists of punchy kick and snare, repetitive wooden percussive elements, shimmering hi hats and open hats and soft crash cymbals. It sounds manic, energetic and kind of muffled, since it was probably recorded with a poor quality microphone."
