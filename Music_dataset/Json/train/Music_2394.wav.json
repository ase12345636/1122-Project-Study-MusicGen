    "caption": "This is the background track of a challenge video. Many sound effects can be heard in procession such as the blood pulse, a metallic impact and clock ticking. Then the piece starts playing with loud synth bass and an electronic drum beat. The aura of the track is unnerving and violent which was the reaction expected in the challenge. Some parts of this track can be used to lift samples for a beat."
