    "caption": "This electronic beat contains digital drums playing a four on the floor groove with percussive elements panned to the left and right side of the speakers. A synthesizer pad is playing one, long and evolving note in the higher register. It sounds like a lot of reverb has been added. This song may be playing in a Minimal/Techno club."
