    "caption": "This is the intro part of a hip-hop beat. There is a rising pattern coming from a synth bass that has its low-pass filter getting dragged to higher frequencies. There is a hype feel to it. This part of the beat can be sampled and looped to be used in the soundtrack of a video game when the main character is simply walking around or exploring the area."
