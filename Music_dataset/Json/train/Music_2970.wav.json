    "caption": "The Rock song instrumental features a mellow synth pad with flanger effect on, and straight piano chords playing in the beginning. In the second part of the loop, there is an electric guitar solo melody layered with synth pad melody and electric guitar power chords layered with powerful bass guitar and energetic crash cymbal. It sounds energetic and powerful, even though it starts softly."
