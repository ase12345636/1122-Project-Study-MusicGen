    "caption": "This is a comedy music piece in the style of a Christmas song. It is an instrumental piece. There is a rhythmic background that is composed of percussive elements. The sleigh bells can be heard very distinctively. The melody is played by a lute in a slightly out-of-sync manner while a tuba is playing the bass line. The piece has a tongue-in-cheek feel to it. This piece could fit well in the soundtrack of a Christmas-themed comedy movie."
