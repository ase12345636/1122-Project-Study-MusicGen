    "caption": "The low quality recording features a rock song that consists of harmonizing male vocals singing over groovy piano melody, groovy bass guitar, electric guitar melody, punchy snare, soft kick hits and shimmering hi-hats. There is a short snare roll that serves as a transition into a new section. It sounds groovy and addictive."
