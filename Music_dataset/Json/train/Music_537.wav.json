There is a piano playing the main melody while a bass guitar is playing in the background. In the rhythmic background, there is an acoustic latin drum beat with percussion playing syncopations all over. There is a lively, upbeat atmosphere. This piece could be played at dance clubs and it could also be used as an accompaniment piece for latin dance courses."
