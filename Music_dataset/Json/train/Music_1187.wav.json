    "caption": "A female vocalist sings this cheerful song. The tempo is fast with a peppy keyboard harmony, simple, march like drumming, steady bass line, acoustic guitar and bells chiming. The song is a foreign language but from the sound and vibe of it, it seems like a fun, happy, joyful, cheerful, warm hearted and popular folk song."
