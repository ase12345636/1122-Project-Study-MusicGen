    "caption": "This is an electroclash piece. There is a male vocalist singing in the lead with hollering samples in the background. An electric guitar is playing the main theme repeatedly. The bass guitar is playing a groovy bass line. In the rhythmic background, there is an upbeat acoustic drum beat. The piece is groovy and danceable. It could be playing in the background at a sports bar or a rock bar. The music would also suit well with sports venues."
