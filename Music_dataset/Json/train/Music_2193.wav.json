    "caption": "This is the live recording of a dance performance that uses a pop music piece as accompaniment. There is a male and a female vocalist singing melodically. The tune of the piece is being played by the electric guitar, the bass guitar and the synth. There is an upbeat acoustic drum beat in the rhythmic background. The audience can be heard clapping to the beat. The atmosphere is loud and lively. It could work well as the backing track in a modern dance course."
