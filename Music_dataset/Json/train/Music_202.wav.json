    "caption": "The R&B music features a male voice singing and being backed by similar male voices from time to time. An electric piano accompanies the singer with long-note chords. The drums play a light rhythm and dictate the flow of the music. Towards the end of the music excerpt a bass guitar starts to play. In the beginning of the passage one can hear a tubular bell being struck once. This sound is very similar to a church bell."
