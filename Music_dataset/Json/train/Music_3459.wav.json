    "caption": "This is a jingle piece playing in the background of a loud toy helicopter video. The video is a bit dated and therefore the sound quality is quite poor. The instrumentation of the piece is barely audible. There is a keyboard playing the melody with a bass guitar and a drum backing. The piece is made up of common sounds and it has a generic aura to it. The sounds from this recording could be sampled for use in beat-making."
