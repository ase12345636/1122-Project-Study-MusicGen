    "caption": "This pop ballad features two male voices singing in octaves. This is accompanied by percussion playing a simple beat. A bass plays the root notes of the chords. A piano plays the chords by striking them just once per bar. When the voice pauses between verses, another voice sings descending pattern vocables in falsetto. When the main voice resumes, a synth fill is played along with a muted guitar. The rest of the instruments continue to play their respective parts. This song has a romantic mood. This song can be played in a romantic movie."
