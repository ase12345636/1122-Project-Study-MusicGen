    "caption": "This song features a mellotron playing a melody using a descending bassline. The higher notes stay the same for the first six counts and then change to a descending pattern. This is followed by short arpeggiated notes. The quality of the recording is low. There are no other instruments in this song. This song can be played in a practice session for somebody learning the keyboard."
