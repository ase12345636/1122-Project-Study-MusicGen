    "caption": "The low quality recording features a pop song played on playback while a male vocalist is mumbling over it. The song consists of a groovy bass, shimmering hi hats, punchy kick and snare hits, mellow bell melody, and flat repetitive female vocals singing over it. The recording is noisy, which is very audible at the very end of the loop where there is a finger licking sound. It still sounds happy and fun."
