    "caption": "The rock music features a male voice singing a repeating melody and being backed by other male vocals. The electric guitar plays fast chords with a distortion effect on and the bass guitar follows with the same speed. The drums play a fast repeating rhythm. The quality of the audio is really low and so this leads me to believe this is an amateur recording."
