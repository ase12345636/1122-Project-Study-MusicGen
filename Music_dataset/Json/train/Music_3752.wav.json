    "caption": "This is a famous pop music piece played over a dance audition video. The male vocalist is singing melodically in one track at a medium pitch and singing the melody at a high pitch in another track. The melody is supported by a bass guitar playing a groovy bassline. A catchy acoustic drum beat and offbeat claps hold the rhythmic background. The atmosphere is jovial and very danceable. This piece could be used in a myriad of different ways from dance videos, online content, sports venues etc."
