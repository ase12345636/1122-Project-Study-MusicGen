    "caption": "This symphonic rock song features a male voice singing the main melody in common time. This is accompanied by percussion playing a simple beat with single and double strokes on the snare in alternate counts. The bass plays only the root notes of the chords with no embellishments. The strings play a repetitive phrase of three notes throughout the song. The mood of the voice is storytelling. This song can be played in a rags to riches movie."
