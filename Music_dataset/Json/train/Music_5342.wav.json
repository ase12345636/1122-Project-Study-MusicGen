    "caption": "This is a glitch music piece. There is a synth sound rising in pitch that resembles a triangle wave. There are granular synth samples being played randomly. A virtual percussive low-to-mid bell sound is playing a melody that resembles a marimba. There is an eerie feeling of flow. This piece could be used in the soundtracks of dystopian sci-fi movies. It could also be used in exploration sequences of video games."
