    "caption": "This is the recording of a gear showcase jam. The only instrument being played is an electric guitar. There is a solo being played while a reverb effect pedal is in use. The atmosphere is easygoing and the tunes are simple. Parts of this piece could be used as samples for beat-making. These samples could also work well for advertisement jingles."
