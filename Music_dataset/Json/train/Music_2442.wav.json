    "caption": "This is an instrumental piece. An electric guitar is playing the melody while another is playing secondary riffs. There is a granular synth holding notes at a high pitch. The overarching atmosphere of this piece is suspenseful. It feels like something big is about to happen that will break the intentionally superficial calmness. This piece would suit perfectly during suspense scenes in a movie soundtrack."
