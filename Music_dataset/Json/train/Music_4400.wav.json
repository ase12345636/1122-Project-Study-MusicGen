    "caption": "The low quality recording features a rock song that contains filtered female vocal singing over loud and harsh electric guitar chords, energetic drums and buzzy bass guitar. It sounds chaotic due to the bad mix and since the drums are panned in an unconventional way - making the stereo image unbalanced. It sounds harsh, but also energetic."
