    "caption": "The Dance/Electronic song features a repetitive synth keys melody, synth guitar lick, distorted synth bass that perfectly complements the \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern, punchy snare hits layered with claps, simple \"2 step\" hi hat pattern, shimmering shakers, repetitive, pulsating synth pad chord progression and groovy synth keys chord progression. At the end of the first part of the loop, there is a short, reversed crash riser, where the drums subtly fade out, followed by energetic crash at the beginning of the second part of the loop, where the drums are brought back again. It sounds energetic and like something you would hear in clubs during the 00s."
