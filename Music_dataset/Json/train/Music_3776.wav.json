    "caption": "This is an intuitive folk/neo-folk music piece. There is a female vocalist singing over multiple tracks, one being the minor harmonies of the other. There is an acoustic guitar playing a gentle, simple tune. The atmosphere of this piece is heart-touching. The music could fit very well in the soundtrack of a drama movie or a TV show."
