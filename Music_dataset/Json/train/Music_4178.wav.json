    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a song that is barely audible due to distorted sound, loud cheering crowd and female screams. There is definitely at least a boomy bass, punchy kick and snare hits and energetic cymbals, alongside some vocals singing over it. It sounds messy and muddy, but also emotional and energetic."
