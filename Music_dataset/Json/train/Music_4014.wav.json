    "caption": "This clip features low quality audio. A synth plays the main melody. The bass plays the root notes of the chords. This is accompanied by programmed percussion playing a simple beat. A constant beep is heard in the foreground, which doubles in tempo at the end of the clip. The instruments cannot be heard clearly due to the beeping sound over the instruments."
