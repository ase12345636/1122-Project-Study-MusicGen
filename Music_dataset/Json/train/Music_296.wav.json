    "caption": "This is an electric guitar jam being performed by a 9 year-old. It is an amateur recording, so there is a constant feedback noise coming from the amp. The electric guitar has a clean sound. The tunes are mostly simple with a lot of muted strokes. The recording has an easygoing atmosphere. If the feedback noise can be bypassed, the tunes from this recording can be used in beat-making."
