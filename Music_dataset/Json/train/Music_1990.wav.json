    "caption": "The music features for the most part an instrumental but almost at the end of the excerpt a male voice starts to yodel. Up to that point the melody is being played by a marimba, then trumpets and horns, possibly trombones too. A tuba is holding the beat pulsation in the low register. At the end of the excerpt a harp can be heard."
