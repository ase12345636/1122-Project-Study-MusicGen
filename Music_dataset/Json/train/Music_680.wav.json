    "caption": "This is a jazz music piece. There is a saxophone playing a solo in the lead. A tuba is playing the bass line. There is an electric guitar strumming chords. The rhythm is being played on the ride cymbal by the acoustic drums. The instrumentals have a sophisticated feel. This piece could be playing in the background at a classy restaurant."
