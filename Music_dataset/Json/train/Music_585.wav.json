    "caption": "The low quality recording features a rock song that consists of reverberant male vocal singing over groovy bass, short electric guitar chords, punchy snare, soft kick hits, shimmering hi hats and soft crash cymbals. The reverb of the vocal is located in the right channel of the stereo image, which makes it sound interesting. It is easygoing and groovy."
