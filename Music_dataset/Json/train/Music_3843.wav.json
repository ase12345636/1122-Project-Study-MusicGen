    "caption": "This is a contemporary reggae song. The vocalist has a smooth and silky voice, the song sounds romantic and intimate. We hear electric guitar chord stabs on the off-beats which characterise the reggae pop style. There are also licks on the electric guitar and a simple drum beat suitable for laid-back dancing. The song has a tropical feel."
