This is accompanied by percussion playing an aggressive metal beat. The bass follows the rhythm guitar for the beginning of the song and later plays licks while the notes of the distortion guitars are sustained. The mood of this song is aggressive. This song can be played on the entrance of a WWE star into the arena."
