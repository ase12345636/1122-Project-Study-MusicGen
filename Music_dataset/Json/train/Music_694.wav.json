    "caption": "This is an instrumental meditation music piece. The only instrument being played is the Tibetan singing bowl. The bowl is being rung repeatedly at varying accentuations. Then, the mallet is being rubbed outside the bowl to interrupt the resonant sound. There is a calming and soothing atmosphere to this recording. It could be used in the background of a meditation video. It could also be sampled for use in beat-making."
