    "caption": "This recording is full of atmospheric sounds that are modulated rising and falling in pitch with liquid klick noises, white noise and a lot of reverb. These sounds are probably created with a synthesizer. A pad sound is playing long notes in the mid range while a soft subbass is underlining the strings. This composition may be playing in an underwater scene in a movie."
