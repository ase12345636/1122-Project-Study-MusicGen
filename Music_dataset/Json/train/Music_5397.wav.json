    "caption": "This is a classical music piece. The piece is being performed on a harpsichord. There is a sophisticated aura to it. The piece has a medieval sound. It would fit perfectly in the soundtrack of a historical drama movie that takes place in the medieval era. It could also work well as the opening theme for a literature YouTube channel."
