    "caption": "This is a live performance of a salsa music piece. The melody is being played by loud and high-pitched trumpets with the backing of the piano and the bass guitar. In the rhythmic background, a group of latin percussive elements are playing such as cowbell and maracas. The atmosphere is vibrant and sensual. This piece could be included in the soundtrack of a romance movie that takes place in the Caribbeans or Latin America."
