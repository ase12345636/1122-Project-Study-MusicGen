    "caption": "Someone is playing a song through speakers. The song contains digital drums with strong loud rhythmic hits rising up in pitch and a kick on every beat. A guitar-like sound is playing an arpeggio melody with other string instruments. This is an amateur recording and of poor sound-quality. This song may be playing at a rave party."
