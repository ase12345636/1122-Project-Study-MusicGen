    "caption": "This is an acoustic comedic piece. The male vocalist is singing in a manner similar to a bard, telling us a story. He is also playing the melody on a ukulele at the same time. The tune is very simple and easygoing. The atmosphere is jovial. This could be used in the soundtrack of a comedy movie or in the background of a funny video."
