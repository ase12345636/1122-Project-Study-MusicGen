    "caption": "This is a classical music piece that resembles the style of a march. It is an instrumental piece performed by a brass orchestra. The main theme is being played by the trombones while a bass line is played by the tuba. The tempo of the piece is slow and this creates an epic but solemn atmosphere. This piece would work perfectly as a movie music piece. It could be playing during the scenes of an important character dying."
