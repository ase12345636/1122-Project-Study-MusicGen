    "caption": "This is a reggae music piece. There is a male vocalist singing in a laid-back manner. The keyboard is playing the main tune. The electric guitar is being strummed in a staccato off-beat pattern. There is a groovy bass line being played by the bass guitar. The rhythmic background consists of a reggae acoustic drum beat. The atmosphere is chill and trippy. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a romance movie with a tropical setting."
