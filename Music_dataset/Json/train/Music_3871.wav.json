    "caption": "This is an instrumental didgeridoo piece performed on the street. The didgeridoo is played at a low-to-medium range while the player is performing a simple rhythmic pattern with the use of percussion at the same time. The atmosphere is eccentric. This recording can be used in the soundtrack of a movie that has a tribal setting."
