    "caption": "The Latin Urban song features an echoing male lead vocal, alongside wide harmonizing harmonizing background vocals and echoing ad libs, rapping over \"4 on the floor kick\" pattern, smooth bass, syncopated snare, shimmering cymbals and wide shimmering shakers, followed by arpeggiated synth keys melody. It sounds uplifting, happy and like something you would dance to with your friends."
