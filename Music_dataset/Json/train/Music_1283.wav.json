    "caption": "This song sounds sensual, slightly erotic. The female voice is singing in the mid range and with delay and reverb on her voice. The bass is playing long notes with little changes. The drums are playing a rather complex groove. An e-guitar is playing single notes contributing to the rhythm while another guitar is playing an almost looped melody on top. This guitar has some effect on it and it sounds sensual and provocative. Synthesizer hits and keys are adding more little elements that are panned to the left and right side of the speakers. This is a very rhythmic song with its harmonic elements. This song may be playing at a nightclub for adults."
