    "caption": "Someone is playing acoustic drums with a lot of fill-ins before breaking into the next part of the song. A e-guitar and e-bass are playing the same melody/chords to elevate the energy. Female voices are singing in harmony before a male voice starts to scream in a higher register and then starts rapping. The e-guitar then is playing, almost clean sound, melody. This song may be playing with headphones while skating."
