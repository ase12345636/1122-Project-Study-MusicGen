    "caption": "This folk song features a male voice singing the main melody in a southern accent. The voice falls in the bass category. This is accompanied by an acoustic guitar strumming chords. The recording is of low quality and there is a lot of white noise drowning the other sounds. A basic percussion instrument is played. The voice is emotional. This song can be played in a retro style movie where a family goes to meet their grandparents out in the countryside."
