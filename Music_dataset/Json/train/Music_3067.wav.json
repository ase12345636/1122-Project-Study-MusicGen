    "caption": "This symphonic song features the string section and brass section playing the main melody. The instruments are playing different parts in harmony. At the beginning, the instruments play a two note descending sequence in which the second note is allowed to ring. Then one note is played and allowed to sustain for six counts followed by a bass note that is played for the remaining counts. A snare plays a pattern during this last sustain. A cymbal is also played at the end of this phrase. There are no voices in this song. This is an instrumental song. This song can be played in a movie about a voyage."
