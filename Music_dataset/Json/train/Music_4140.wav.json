    "caption": "This is a simple dubstep piece. Electronic drums and percussion are played at the rhythmic background at 120 BPM. There is a high-pitched synth and a fuzzy synth bass playing a simple melody. The all-around quality of the sounds are a bit old-fashioned, reminiscing of the early 2000s. The piece has a danceable, trippy feel to it. It could be used in a retro-themed venue."
