    "caption": "A male vocalist sings this lively pop rock. The tempo is medium with an intense electric guitar harmony, punchy drumming, groovy bass lines and keyboard harmony. The song is muffled as the audio quality is inferior but it sounds enthusiastic, youthful, passionate and vibrant. This could be a live performance as there are background sounds of people talking, coughing, rustling. This song is Pop Rock."
