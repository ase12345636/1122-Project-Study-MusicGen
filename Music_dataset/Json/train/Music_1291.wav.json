    "caption": "This is an instrumental alternative music piece. There are two electric guitars with heavy effects playing chill melodies. A distinct crackling effect can be heard. The rhythm consists of a medium tempo percussion beat. The atmosphere is trippy. This piece can be used in the soundtrack of a drama movie, especially during a flashback scene involving good memories."
