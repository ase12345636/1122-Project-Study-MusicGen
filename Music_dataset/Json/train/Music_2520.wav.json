    "caption": "This is a medieval sounding music piece. There is a virtual harp playing the main melody while strings are holding the root notes of the tune. The use of these sounds induces a story-telling atmosphere similar to a bard's song. This piece would suit well with historical/adventure movies or video games. It could also be used in the background at a theater play."
