    "caption": "The Reggae song features a flat male vocal rapping over shimmering cymbals, heavy bass, bouncy snare, wide sustained synth lead and \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern. Even though the song is uptempo, it sounds easygoing and like something you would listen to in a car, or while chilling."
