    "caption": "This is an amateur recording of a sound check jam. The audio quality is quite poor with an emphasis on the drum sound. There is a male vocal that can be barely heard over the sound of the bass guitar and the acoustic drums. The piece is easygoing. This recording can be sampled for use in beat-making."
