    "caption": "Electronic dance music features a repeating melody played by an electronic sound. The beat of the music is being driven by a kick drum played on every beat, a hi-hat played four times every beat and some sampled claps played on beats two and four. In the background one can hear an altered female voice singing a short melody. Another electronic/synth sound can be heard in the background having sparse interventions. The music is meant to be danced to."
