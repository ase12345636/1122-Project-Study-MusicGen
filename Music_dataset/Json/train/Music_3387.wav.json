    "caption": "This is a cinematic classical music piece. There is a piano playing the chords while the strings are holding the melodic background. There is a mysterious ambient synth sound coming and going. A repetitive low-to-mid frequency percussive sound effect is being played to imply the sound of whales. The atmosphere of the piece is reminiscent of both underwater and outer space at the same time. That is why it could be used in science fiction movies and shows that have an aquatic or outer space setting."
