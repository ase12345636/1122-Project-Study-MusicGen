    "caption": "A drum is playing a groove and sounds like running through a low pass filter opening up. Synthesizer pads are playing a simple melody that gets repeated in the lower register with overtones. Panned to both sides of the speaker a simple melody is playing pulsating synth sounds. A   male voice is singing/streaming/rapping. The voice seems to be pitched down and processed with other effects. This song may be playing in a scary videogame."
