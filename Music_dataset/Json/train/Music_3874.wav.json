    "caption": "The low quality recording features a rock song that consists of a passionate female vocal singing over punchy kick and snare hits, shimmering hi hats, wide electric guitar melody and groovy bass guitar. It sounds energetic and addictive in the first half of the loop, while in the second part it's mellow and softer."
