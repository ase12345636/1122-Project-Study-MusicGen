    "caption": "This is a heavily edited version of a birthday song. The track has been transposed to make the original vocal sound like a little girl which resulted in a chipmunk vocal effect. The piano playing the melody and the electronic drum beat is at an irritatingly higher pitch than normal. This creates a bizarre atmosphere. It could be used in nightmare sequences in video games or TV shows."
