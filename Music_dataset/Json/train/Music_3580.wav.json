    "caption": "This song starts with a descending phrase played on a synth. This is followed by an ascending phrase on another synth. This is accompanied by simple programmed percussion playing the hi-hat on the first two counts and the fourth count of each bar. The snare is played on the third count of each bar. After four bars, the percussion plays a roll and the bass plays one note two times. The synth sounds in the background get louder when the roll is played. There are no voices in this song. This song can be played in a night club."
