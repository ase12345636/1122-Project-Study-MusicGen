    "caption": "The low quality recording features an afrobeat song that consists of an echoing female vocal, with autotune effect on, rapping over energetic cymbals, wide percussion rolls, stab buzzy bass, shimmering hi hats and short strings stabs. At the end of the loop, there is a flat male vocal talking over the beat. It sounds energetic and like something you would easily dance to."
