    "caption": "This is a rock music piece playing in the background of a tutorial video. There is an electric guitar playing a simple tune as the lead while another provides a rhythmic backing by playing the same note repeatedly in rapid procession. There is an acoustic drum beat playing. There are water sound effects related to the video. The piece has a generic feeling. It does not evoke much excitement. It could be used as a jingle for an advertisement or in the background of an instructive video."
