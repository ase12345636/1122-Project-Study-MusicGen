    "caption": "This is a live performance of an alternative rock music piece. There is a male vocalist singing in a drowsy manner in the lead. The main tune is being played by a keyboard with an organ sound meanwhile the electric guitar and the bass guitar are supporting it in the background. The rhythm is being provided by a slow tempo acoustic drum beat. The atmosphere is melancholic. This piece can be used in the soundtrack of a drama TV series, especially during the scenes where a character feels like they are depressed."
