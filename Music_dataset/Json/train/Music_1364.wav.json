    "caption": "This dance pop song features a male voice singing the main melody in a foreign language. This is accompanied by percussion playing a dance beat. The percussion is programmed. The bass plays the root notes of the chords. Synth sounds are played in the background. Bowed lute play fills in between lines to give this song a middle-eastern feel. This song can be played in a club. The mood of this song is flirty."
