    "caption": "This song contains an e-piano playing a major and minor chord melody along with a minimalistic digital drum groove that has a delay on it. A female voice is singing with a little reverb on her voice. The song sounds minimalistic. There is a lot of room for the voice to sing and for the other instruments. A shaker sound is spun to the right side of the speaker. This song may be playing with headphones running through the park."
