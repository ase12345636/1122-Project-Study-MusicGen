    "caption": "This music is an electric guitar instrumental. The tempo is very fast with the guitarist playing a very animated riff rapidly with a lot of dexterity. There is no accompaniment except for the sound of rhythmic clicking which could be percussion or just the sound of fingers moving along the guitar rapidly. The audio quality is inferior so the sounds are sharp, piercing , loud and a little unpleasant to the ear."
