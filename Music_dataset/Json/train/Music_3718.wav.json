The electric guitar and the bass guitar is playing a groovy melody while occasional synth sounds from the keyboard can be heard. The rhythmic background consists of a slow tempo reggae acoustic drum beat. The atmosphere is chill. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a summertime movie taking place on a tropical island."
