This is accompanied by a female voice singing vocals in an angelic voice in the background. Programmed percussion plays a simple beat with the hi-hat being struck at every count. The bass plays the root notes of the chords. The bass notes are allowed to ring. This song has a slow tempo. This song can be played in a club."
