    "caption": "This is a rap music piece played behind a rollerskating video. The sound of the skaters can be heard faintly throughout the recording. There is a male voice rapping at the forefront while other voices can be heard singing melodically in the background and ad-libbing occasionally. There is a mild keyboard playing the tune while a loud electronic drum beat is playing the rhythm. The atmosphere of this piece is groovy and urban."
