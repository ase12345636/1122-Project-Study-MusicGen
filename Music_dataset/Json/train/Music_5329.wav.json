    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a reggae song and it consists of a fruity male vocal preparing to sing over shimmering hi hats, snappy rimshots, funky electric guitar chords and groovy bass. As it is a live performance, there are some crowd whistling and cheering noises in the background. It sounds easygoing and exciting."
