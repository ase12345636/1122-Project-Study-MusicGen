    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a folk rock song that consists of harmonizing vocals singing over shimmering hi hats, snappy rimshots, groovy bass guitar and acoustic rhythm guitar, followed by some crowd claps. It sounds messy, muddy and distorted, but still emotional and passionate too."
