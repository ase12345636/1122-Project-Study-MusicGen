    "caption": "An acoustic drum is playing a groove that is not strongly connected to reggae rhythm. A e-bass and piano-keys are bringing the typical reggae backbeat while another synth sound is playing short plucks as a melody. The male voice is singing in a reggae-fashion and in a higher key. In the background you can hear a big organ sound coming in and playing along with the melody. The elements are spread along the speakers. This song may be playing with speakers riding on your bike."
