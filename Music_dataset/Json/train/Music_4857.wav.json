    "caption": "The low quality recording features a flat male vocal singing over tinny wooden percussions, punchy \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern, groovy bass, long crash cymbal, shimmering shakers, syncopated snare hits and electric guitar melody. In the first half of the loop, there is a short snippet of crowd cheering and clapping over brass melody. It sounds fun, happy and energetic."
