    "caption": "This pop song starts off with the backing singers singing vocables in harmony. This is backed by percussion playing a simple beat. The bass plays a flourish ending on the root note of the next chord. The string section plays high pitched notes. The piano plays a flourish of ascending notes before the main female voice starts to sing the main melody. This is accompanied by the percussion continuing with the simple beat. The string section fades away. The bass plays a descending walk down and ends on a high note. This song has a romantic feel. This song can be played in a romantic movie."
