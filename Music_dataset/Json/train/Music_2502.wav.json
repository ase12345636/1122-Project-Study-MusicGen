    "caption": "The low quality recording features a reggae song sung by emotional male vocalists, followed by percussive elements, groovy bass, offbeat electric guitar and organ chords. There are some crowd noises in the background. The audio is crackling, making it low quality, but regardless it sounds easygoing."
