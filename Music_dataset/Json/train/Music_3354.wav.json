    "caption": "This is a Swiss rap music piece. There is a male vocal rapping in the German language. The melody consists of a repeating theme played by a synth sound. A low-to-medium range string sample can be heard every now and then. The rhythmic background consists of an electronic drum beat which contains very faint clicking sounds added for texture. It is an urban sounding piece. This piece would fit perfectly in the soundtrack of a crime movie that takes place in the ghettos of a German-speaking city."
