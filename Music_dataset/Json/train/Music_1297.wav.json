    "caption": "This is a live performance of a pop music piece. There is a teenage female vocalist singing melodically in the Spanish language. An acoustic guitar plays the main tune while there is a slow tempo acoustic drum beat in the rhythmic background. The spectators are joining the song at a volume that is sometimes higher than the song itself and it creates an irritating aura."
