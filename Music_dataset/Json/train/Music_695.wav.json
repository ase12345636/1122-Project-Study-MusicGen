    "caption": "The low quality recording features a cover of a song sung by passionate girl vocalists over acoustic guitar melody and smooth bass. The recording is very noisy and crackly. Judging by the quality of it, the vocalist is singing on a very cheap sounding microphone - which makes the sound quality even worse."
