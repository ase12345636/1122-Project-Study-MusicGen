    "caption": "This audio recording features a crickets sound effect, sea waves sound effect and mellow synth pad chords in the background, followed by shimmering tambourine and muffled snare. At the very end of the first section of the loop, there is a short filter modulation riser, after which there is silence. At the very end of the loop there is a soft white noise down sweep. It sounds very relaxing and calming, especially because of the pad and sound effects."
