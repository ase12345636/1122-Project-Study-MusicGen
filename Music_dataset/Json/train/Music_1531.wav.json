    "caption": "This song is a crossover of a reggae song with a soul song. This features a male voice singing the main melody. It starts off with the voice which is accompanied by the guitar, bass and percussion playing in the pause between lines. During the pause, a synth sound is played which is modulated by a ring modulator. After the pause, the voice starts the main melody. Trumpets play a melody. The bass and percussion continue to play with a reggae feel. Female backing voices sing vocables. This song is relaxing. This song can be played at the end of a war movie."
