    "caption": "This is a Hindi film music piece. This is an instrumental piece. The harmonica is playing a cheerful melody in the lead. The glockenspiel is playing a secondary melody while the acoustic guitar and the bass guitar are supporting them in the background. The acoustic drums are playing a jazz swing beat with the brushes. The atmosphere is lively. This piece could be used in a feelgood movie during scenes where everything is going well for the main character."
