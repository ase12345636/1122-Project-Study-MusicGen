    "caption": "This music is an electronic instrumental. The tempo is medium with a steady, rhythmic keyboard harmony, simple drumming and groovy bass lines. There are sounds of crashing, glass breaking, explosions or gunshots in the background superimposing over the music. The sounds are in stark contrast to the melodious music, with the crashing and shooting giving it an aggressive vibe;"
