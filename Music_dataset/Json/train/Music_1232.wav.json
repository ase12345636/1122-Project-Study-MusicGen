    "caption": "This is an orchestra playing Arabic music. The melody is played by the conjunction of multiple instruments such as violin, flute and qanun while tambourines create the percussive background of the piece. It has an oriental atmosphere that could be very fitting in a movie or a show taking place in the Middle East. It could also be a good background music for Arab cuisine restaurants."
