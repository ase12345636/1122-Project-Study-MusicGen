    "caption": "This is a poor quality Christian pop music compilation. There are many pieces sung by male and female voices melodically. The usual theme of the instrumental backing consists of a tune played in major key by an electric guitar and a bass guitar alongside a simple acoustic drum beat. The overall atmosphere is uplifting. This mix could be used in a movie to imply the sounds coming from a gospel radio station in passing."
