    "caption": "This song contains an acoustic drum playing along to a e-guitar strumming chords before breaking into a more silent part with the e-bass repeating the same note. The e-guitar is playing a simple short melody with delay. Then a deeper male voice is singing and the crowd starts cheering. This recording is in bad audio-quality. This song may be playing at a live concert."
