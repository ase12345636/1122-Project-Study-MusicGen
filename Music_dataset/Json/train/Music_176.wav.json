    "caption": "This amateur recording features a classic song. This is an instrumental song featuring a violin solo. This is accompanied by percussion playing a simple beat. A keyboard plays chords in the background with fills in between bars. The bass plays the root note and the lower fifth of the chord. There are no voices in this song. Due to the low quality of sound, the other instruments are unclear. This song can be played in a classic movie."
