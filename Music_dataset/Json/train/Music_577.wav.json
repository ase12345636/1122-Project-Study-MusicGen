    "caption": "The low quality recording features a trap song that consists of flat male vocals, alongside wide harmonizing male vocals, singing over punchy 808 bass and repetitive synth lead melody in the background. There is a high pitched riser at the end of the loop. It sounds groovy and addictive thanks to that cadence."
