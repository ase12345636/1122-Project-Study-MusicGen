    "caption": "This is a sped-up trap remix of an R&B music piece. There is a female vocalist singing melodically with her vocal sample used in beat repeats. There is a hollering sample added alongside it. The beat has a strong synth bass with a repeating acoustic guitar sample playing every now and then. The electronic drum beat is slightly fast-paced and filled with cicada hi-hats. The atmosphere is loud and upbeat. This piece could be used as an accompaniment piece at a modern break dance course. It could also be played at nightclubs."
