    "caption": "This song features a distortion guitar playing a guitar solo. The solo is played at a high pitch. It is a slow tempo solo. The guitarist plays a lot of vibrato when the notes are allowed to ring for a while. The pattern follows three ascending notes followed by three strikes on a lower note. This is followed by one higher note, the lower note and a hammer on to a higher note. A synth plays backing chords. There are no other instruments in this song. The mood of this song is romantic."
