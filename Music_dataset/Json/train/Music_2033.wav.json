    "caption": "This song has a catchy synthesizer bassline that is repeating. The electronic drums are playing a four on the floor techno groove with some tambourines and some processed crash sounds. The elements are gently panned to the left and right side of the speakers. The male voice is rapping over the instrumental while a low pitched vocal sample melody is singing a melody and some pieces of that are also panned to the left and right side of the speakers along with some reverb and light delay. This song may be playing in a club or a beach party."
