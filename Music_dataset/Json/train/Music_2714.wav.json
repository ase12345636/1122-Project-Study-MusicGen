    "caption": "The Rock song features a flat male vocal singing over arpeggiated electric guitar melody located in the right channel of the stereo image, groovy bass guitar, punchy kick and snare hits and shimmering hi hats. The stereo image is unbalanced because of the electric guitar, which makes it lean towards the right channel. It sounds energetic, groovy, happy and fun."
