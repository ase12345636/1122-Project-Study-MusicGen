    "caption": "The Electro song features a filter modulated synth melody, groovy synth bass, shimmering hi hats, punchy kick and snare hits, followed by short snare roll, haunting synth lead, low pitched male vocal introducing the section and high pitched riser that builds the energy up. It sounds energetic, upbeat and exciting - like something you would hear in clubs."
