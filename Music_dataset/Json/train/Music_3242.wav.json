    "caption": "This dubstep song features a turntable being played. It starts off with a high frequency pitch that is being brought down to a lower pitch till it fades away. A male voice raps a line and the instruments pause momentarily. This is followed by scratching of a vinyl in a pattern. This is accompanied by programmed percussion playing a dubstep beat. The sounds played are all synthesized by the DJ console. This song can be played in a club."
