    "caption": "This pop song starts with children's voices singing a melody. This is accompanied by a tuba playing the low registers. A string section plays a repetitive staccato phrase. This is followed by a phrase played on a trumpet and a descend run played on bells. The children's voice repeats the first melody once again. In between the sound of church bells is played. This song has a holiday feel. This song can be played in the intro credits of a holiday movie."
