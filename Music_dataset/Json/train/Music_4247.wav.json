    "caption": "This amateur recording features a shofar being played. It sounds like a bugle. The melody starts on a low note followed by a higher note and alternates the same with a long ring of the high note. It is played in a place with a lot of reverb. There are no other instruments in this song. There are no voices in this song. This can be played in a movie scene just before a war."
