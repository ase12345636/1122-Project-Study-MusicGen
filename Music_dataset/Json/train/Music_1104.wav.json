    "caption": "This is a DJ freestyle performance with old-school and latin house influences. There is a female vocalist singing melodically with an 80s pop feel. A fuzzy synth bass is playing a groovy bass line. In the rhythmic background, there is an electronic drum beat with a 909-like sound. The atmosphere is eccentric and the sound is modern. This performance could be played at nightclubs or dance clubs."
