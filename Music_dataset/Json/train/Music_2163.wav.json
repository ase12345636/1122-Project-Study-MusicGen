    "caption": "The song is an instrumental. The tempo is medium with a brass including trumpets and saxophones playing in harmony, wooden xylophones and Latin percussions play accompaniment to the band along with a male singer. The song is exciting and groovy. The audio quality is poor and probably a home recording."
