    "caption": "Punk rock with a country twang, featuring an acoustic guitar strumming, an overdriven electric guitar playing lead, multiple male vocalists, male background vocals and a simple chord progression. The drums play an uptempo country beat, or \"train beat\" more specifically. The kind of band you might hear at a pub in a semi-rural suburb."
