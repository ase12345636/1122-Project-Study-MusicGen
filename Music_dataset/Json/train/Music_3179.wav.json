    "caption": "This amateur recording starts off with the sound of the crowd at a live show. This is followed by a male voice mouthing four blasting sounds over the mic. This is followed by a guitar playing a funk riff and another guitar playing a lower register melody. The percussion plays a fast beat. The bass plays only one note in a continuous pattern following the percussion. The mood of this song is upbeat. This song can be played in a retro club."
