    "caption": "This is a live Christian gospel music performance. There is male lead vocal singing melodically and passionately with the backing of a male choir. The melody is being played by a church organ and a bass guitar. The acoustic drums and the tambourine played in a very eccentric manner are the elements of the rhythmic background. The atmosphere is religious. This piece could be played at Christian religious events or in the background of Christian social media content."
