    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a gospel song and it consists of passionate male vocal singing over harmonizing mixed choir in the background. The recording is a bit noisy and it has some footsteps sounds in it, but overall it sounds passionate, emotional and soulful - as every gospel song should sound."
