    "caption": "The Metal song features a repetitive, aggressive male vocal screaming over wide, aggressive electric guitar chords, distorted bass guitar, punchy snare and kick hits and energetic cymbals. There is a toms roll at the end of the loop. It sounds aggressive, energetic and manic - like something you would jump into a mosh pit at the concert."
