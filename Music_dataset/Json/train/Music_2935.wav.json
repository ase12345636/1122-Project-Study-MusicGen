    "caption": "A male vocalist sings this energetic song. The tempo is fast with boomy bass lines, steady drumming, keyboard harmony and enthusiastic electric guitar riff with vocal backup. The audio quality is very bad and the song is muffled and muddy. This song is a live performance with ambient sounds of people clapping and cheering."
