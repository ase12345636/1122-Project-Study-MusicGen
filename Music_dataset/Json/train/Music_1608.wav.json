    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a rock song and it consists of flat male vocal singing over arpeggiated electric guitar melody, groovy bass guitar, shimmering hi hats, snappy rimshots and punchy kicks. In the background, there are some crowd singing and crowd cheering noises. It sounds emotional and a bit addictive."
