    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of fruity male vocal singing over funky piano melody and beat played on playback that consists of punchy snare and kick hits, shimmering hi hats and smooth bass. The crowd is also singing along, harmonizing with the lead vocal. It sounds emotional and groovy, even though the recording is noisy."
