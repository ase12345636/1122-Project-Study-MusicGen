    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a rock song that's sung by flat male vocals and played by electric guitars, groovy bass guitar and energetic drums that consists of punchy kick and snare hits and some short snare rolls, energetic cymbals and shimmering hi-hats. At one point in the loop, it seems that the drummer fell out of rhythm, so it kind of sounds sloppy. It also sounds very noisy, messy, muddy, but still energetic too."
