    "caption": "This is an amateur recording of a live beatboxing performance. The beatbox is being performed initially slowly and then at a fast tempo. The recording is a bit dated, so the quality is quite low. The sounds from the setting of the recording such as the crowd cheering for the performer can be heard. Parts of this recording can be lifted as samples to be used in beat-making."
