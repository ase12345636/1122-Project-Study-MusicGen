    "caption": "A female voice is singing, sounding sensual while an acoustic piano is playing a ballad with a change in keys and strings being played with long strokes. The song sounds sensual and dramatic. You can hear some clicking sounds in the recording. This song may be played at a karaoke bar. This song seems to be an amateur recording."
