    "caption": "The low quality recording features a compilation of pop songs. The first song features an echoing female vocal sining, alongside wide harmonizing female vocals, over arpeggiated solo electric guitar melody, sustained strings progression, smooth bass, soft kick hits, punchy snare, simple hi hats and shimmering open hat. At the very end of the loop, there is a short snippet of the second song that consists of flat female vocals singing over claps, synth keys melody and punchy kick. It sounds emotional and passionate, even though the mix is bad."
