    "caption": "This is a latin dance piece. There are two vocals taking turns singing the same line repeatedly. There is a keyboard and a trumpet playing the main melody. A fast-paced electronic percussion is playing in the rhythmic background. This is a dizzyingly high tempo song. It is very danceable. This piece can be played in latin nightclubs and latin dance courses."
