    "caption": "The low quality recording features a funk song that consists of passionate male vocal singing over shimmering open hats and shakers, funky and groovy keys melody, groovy bass, wooden percussive elements and \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern. It is noisy, but also funky and the stereo image is unbalanced, as the song is leaning towards the right channel."
