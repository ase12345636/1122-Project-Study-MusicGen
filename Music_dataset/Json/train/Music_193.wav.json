    "caption": "This audio contains a cinematic composition with evolving synth drone sounds. Higher pitched pads, noise sounds panning to both sides of the speakers and arpeggiated short percussive pluck sounds. Some synth strings are playing a dissonant harmony creating more tension. A marimba hit is being played with a lot of reverb. This song may be playing for a movie-scene full of tension."
