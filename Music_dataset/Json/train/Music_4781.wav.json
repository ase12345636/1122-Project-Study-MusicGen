    "caption": "This slow rock song features a guitar playing arpeggiated chords. The guitar has added effects of chorus and reverb. The bass plays a descending run in the scale of the chords. The percussion plays the different cymbals one after the other. The recording quality is low. There are no voices in this song. This song can be played in a dreamy sequence of a movie."
