    "caption": "This is an upbeat Arabic dance pop song. There's an energetic male singer with a heavily autotuned voice who sings to the beat. The beat features a four on the floor kick drum pattern and hi-hats being played in a pattern of 16th notes. There's a rapid repeated synth melody riff. The song would be heard at a dance club."
