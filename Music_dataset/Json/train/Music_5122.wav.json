    "caption": "This is a street performance by a drum & pipe band. In the beginning, there is a female voice talking. Then, she starts playing the Scottish bagpipes in a joyful manner. A male voice shouts at the crowd to get them into mood and the crowd starts cheering. The atmosphere is vibrant. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a historical drama movie that takes place in Scotland."
