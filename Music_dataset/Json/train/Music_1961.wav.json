    "caption": "The low quality recording features a steel guitar solo melody playing over smooth instrumental on playback that consists of snappy rimshots, wide acoustic rhythm guitar, groovy piano chords, soft bass guitar, soft kick hits and shimmering hi hats. It sounds easygoing and chill - something you would hear in a restaurant or a coffee shop."
