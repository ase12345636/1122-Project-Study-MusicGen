    "caption": "This audio contains a string instrument playing a melody with a bow in the higher mid range. Someone is picking a harp while strings are playing long notes in the background. A deep and low bass is also almost serving as a soft kick hit. A flute is playing a short melody with a lot of reverb at the end. This song may be playing while doing qigong."
