    "caption": "Someone is playing acoustic drums with a half open hi hat holding a simple rock groove with snare hits as fill-ins. An e-bass plays a bassline along while an e-guitar is strumming slightly distorted chords. A male voice is singing in the mid-range. The whole recording sounds clean but is not a high professional recording. This song may be playing at a local festival."
