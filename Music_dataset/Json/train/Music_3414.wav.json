An acoustic drum and e-bass are holding the groove while a piano and e-guitar are playing the same chords. Another e-guitar is playing a melody, almost repeating the singer's melody as a response. The e-guitar is running through an effect. The guitars are panned to the left and right side of the speakers. This song may be playing at a scene of a rom-com movie."
