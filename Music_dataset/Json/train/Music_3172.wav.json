    "caption": "This is a latin pop song with a chipmunk effect. There is a female and a male vocal singing melodically but at a higher pitch than the original. An acoustic guitar and a bass guitar play in the melodic background while a latin electronic drum beat is in the rhythmic background. The piece is very danceable. The piece could be used at a children's dancing course as an accompaniment. It could also be used in the background of funny social media content."
