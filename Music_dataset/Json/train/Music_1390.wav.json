    "caption": "This is an electronic music piece with characteristics of the German industrial scene. A sharp synth is playing the main theme while there is a faint high-pitched pad in the background. A transition effect is used before the drum beat starts. The rhythmic background is provided by a medium tempo electronic drum beat. There is an eerie atmosphere to this piece. It could be used in the soundtrack of a dystopian-future themed movie or a video game."
