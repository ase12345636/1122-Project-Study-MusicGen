    "caption": "The low quality recording features a rock song that consists of throaty male vocal singing over widely spread arpeggiated electric guitar melody, smooth bass guitar, punchy snare, shimmering hi hats and soft kick hits. It sounds thin, distorted and messy, since the frequencies are clashing."
