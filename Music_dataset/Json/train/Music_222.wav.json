    "caption": "The low quality recording features a DJ scratching his vinyl track that consists of a boomy 808 bass, low male vocal, laser synth lead melody, soft white noise, low synth down sweep and wide short snare roll. There is some widely spread snare roll at the end of the first section of the loop. It sounds energetic and a bit chaotic."
