    "caption": "This techno song features a male voice singing the main melody. A female voice is heard singing vocables in the background. In the beginning of this clip, the voice is accompanied by a programmed percussion playing the kick at every count and the snare at alternate counts. A synth is playing the same melody as the main voice. A siren is playing in the background. After two bars of eight counts, the percussion plays a roll and the bass plays a groovy bassline. The synth plays a ring modulated sound. This song can be played in a club."
