    "caption": "The Romance song features an electric guitar lick, low toms roll and soft crash cymbal, followed by emotional piano chord progression and wide background crowd screams, as the passionate male vocal sings over it. Judging by the crowd sound effect, it seems that this is a live performance. Sounds emotional, passionate, heartfelt and romantic."
