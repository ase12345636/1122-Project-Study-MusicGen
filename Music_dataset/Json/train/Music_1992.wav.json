    "caption": "This salsa song features a male voice. It starts off with the keyboard and bass playing a synchronized melody. The percussion is played only as a rimshot in a grouping of two strokes followed by a group of three strokes. This is followed by a male voice singing one word. The rest of the instruments start playing at a faster tempo. The main melody of the song is played on the trumpet and saxophone. This is accompanied by percussion playing a salsa beat. A keyboard plays chords with a salsa feel. This song can be played at a dance party."
