    "caption": "An electro swing, or swing house track featuring a four on the floor kick pattern, acoustic jazz piano sample playing a classic rhythm changes chord progression, a female blues singer, synthesizer risers, ambient bell sounds, a walking synth bassline and a snare on backbeat. Would be fitting music for a modern day speakeasy."
