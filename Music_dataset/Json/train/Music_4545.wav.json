    "caption": "A female voice is singing with a little bit of reverb and delay on her voice. A synth pad is playing a soft string drone sound in the mid-range. An acoustic guitar is playing an arpeggio melody along with a synth pluck sound walking down a scale and another pluck sound playing a melody on top. All of them have different rhythm structures and seem to play against each other but fitting perfectly together. The sounds are spread across both sides of the speakers. This song may be playing in a ceremony at a festival."
