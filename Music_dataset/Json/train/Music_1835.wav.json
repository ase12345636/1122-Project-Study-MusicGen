    "caption": "This piece of audio contains a modern pop song with drums, effects panned to left and right, a female voice singing with delay before changing into a totally different song that sounds more like a fast paced country song with a synthesizer- melody; acoustic drums and a banjo playing a fast melody along. This recording is also full of voice samples, a tiger or lion roaring, a telephone ringing. According to all these sounds and fast paced changes, it can be assumed that this recording is best played at a comedic television show for kids."
