    "caption": "The low quality recording features a cover with a steel drums tropical melody that plays over the playback instrumental in the background that consists of groovy bass, claps, \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern, shimmering shakers and tinny percussive elements. It sounds tropical, exotic and groovy, but it also has an unbalanced stereo image."
