    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a folk/country song that consists of flat female vocal singing over smooth double bass, groovy acoustic rhythm guitar, violins melody and groovy snare rhythm. It sounds a bit noisy and roomy, as it was probably recorded with a stereo microphone technique, but also energetic, uptempo and groovy."
