    "caption": "This song features a melody played on an acoustic guitar. Delay and reverb effects are added to the sound. This song starts off with notes being fingerpicked. The second bar involves a chord being held and allowed to ring for four counts. This is followed by a double stop and then descending notes played with a higher open string. The melody is romantic. There are no voices in this song. This song can be played in a romantic movie."
