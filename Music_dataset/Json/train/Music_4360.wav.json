    "caption": "The low quality recording features a door opening, room tone ambience, clothes movement and chain rattle sound effects, followed by repetitive high pitched male chant, weird male chant, sudden, loud white noise layered with male scream. In the second part of the clip, there is a synth pad in the background. It sounds aggressive, loud, harsh and weird, almost like a parody clip."
