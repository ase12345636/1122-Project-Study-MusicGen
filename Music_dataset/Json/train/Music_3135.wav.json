    "caption": "This classic pop song features a female voice singing the main melody. This is accompanied by electronic drums playing the snare. The snare is played alternating between 1 beat and two beats for every count in each bar. The bass plays a groovy lick using the root notes of the chords. Hand caps are played at different intervals in this song. At the end, a synth plays a chord, a lower chord and back to the first chord. This song has a happy feel. This song can be played in a retro movie scene involving a casino."
