    "caption": "The low quality recording features harmonizing vocals singing over punchy kick and snare hits, shimmering hi hats, synth pads, simple bass and mellow piano chords. There are crowd cheering noises in the background as this is a live performance. It sounds passionate, emotional, exciting and the recording is noisy, in mono and slightly distorted."
