    "caption": "This song contains acoustic drums holding the rhythm together with a bass and almost clean e-guitar strumming chords. A piano is adding single notes on top while a male voice is singing a melody getting backed up by a female voice singing along. In the background motor race sounds can be heard. This song may be playing in a car with windows open on a road trip."
