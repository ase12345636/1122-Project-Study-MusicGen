    "caption": "This is a Russian lullaby piece with classical music elements. The male vocalist is singing at a medium-to-high pitch in an opera-like manner. The strings and the piano are playing a gentle but crestfallen melody. The atmosphere is haunting. This piece could fit perfectly in the soundtrack of a post-apocalyptic war movie or a video game of similar theme. It could also work well in the soundtrack of a drama movie or an art movie that takes place in Russia or Eastern Europe. It might also be playing in the background at a high-tier Russian cuisine restaurant."
