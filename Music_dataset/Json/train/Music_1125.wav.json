    "caption": "A male vocalist sings this popular Christmas carol . The tempo is medium with soft acoustic guitar and steady drumming. The emphasis is on vocals and the highlight of this song is the cheerful and perfectly synced and harmonised vocalisation. It adds layers and textures and gives this age old song a makeover. It is light, happy, peppy, joyful, playful and cheerful."
