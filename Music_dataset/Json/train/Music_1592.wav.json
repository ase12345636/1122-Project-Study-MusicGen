    "caption": "A e-guitar takes the lead melody along with the hammond organ. The drums and the bass are providing a rock groove in the background. Another e-guitar is playing along with the bass on the lower notes, it's highly distorted and has some overdrive on it. The male singer streams and sings. His voice is full of reverb and delay. The whole recording is of poor quality. This song may be playing at an old bar."
