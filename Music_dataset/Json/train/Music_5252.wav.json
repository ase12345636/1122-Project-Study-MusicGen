    "caption": "The commercial music features a groovy piano melody played over snare rolls in the first half of the loop. Right after, there is a drop that consists of a punchy \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern, shimmering hi hats, claps, groovy piano and wide synth lead melody. It sounds happy, fun, euphoric and exciting."
