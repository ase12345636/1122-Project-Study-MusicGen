    "caption": "The Electro song features a reverberant reversed piano melody and synth bass with a modulated filter effect on it, over which there is a white noise riser that leads into the short snippet of drop that consists of layered punchy kick and shimmering hi hat. Right before the drop, there is a filtered, echoing male vocal too. It sounds emotional and exciting."
