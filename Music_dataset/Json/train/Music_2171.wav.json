    "caption": "This is an instrumental latin music piece. There is a keyboard playing a few notes. The acoustic drums start playing initially by hitting a small cymbal repeatedly and then performing drum rolls on the snare drum. The drum rolls sound very much alike to the style of a marching band. Parts of this recording can be sampled for use in beat-making."
