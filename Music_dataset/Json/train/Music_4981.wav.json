    "caption": "This is a techno remix of a polka music piece. There is a female vocalist singing and yodeling. Once the remix kicks in, the male vocal sample can be heard singing a bass line. There is a loud electronic drum beat for the rhythmic background. The vocals have a slight sidechain effect on kick drum hits. The atmosphere is playful. The piece is in low resolution. This piece can be used in the background of funny social media content."
