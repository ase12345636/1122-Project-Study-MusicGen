    "caption": "This song contains a fast drum&bass drum that gets supported by a bass and a synthlead sound on top of it. Both play the same melody. Some different samples get drowned in. They sound like dog-barks that have been processed with effects and a lower bitrate. In the background different sound-effects are rising up in pitch. This song sounds hectic and energetic. This song may be playing in a dance club."
