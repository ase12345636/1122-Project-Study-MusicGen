    "caption": "This is a folk music piece from the Balkans. It is an instrumental piece performed with virtual sounds. The leading tune is played by a realistic accordion sound. There is an upbeat bass guitar following the rhythm of a fast tempo acoustic sounding drum beat. The atmosphere is cheerful. This piece could be the perfect accompaniment piece for a Balkan folk dancing course. It could also fit well in the soundtrack of a comedy movie that takes place in the Balkan region."
