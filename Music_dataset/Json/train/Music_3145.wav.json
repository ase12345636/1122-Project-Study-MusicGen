A clean sounding electric guitar is playing a simple tune while a keyboard is holding the chords and a bass guitar is playing in the background. The rhythmic background is provided by a medium tempo electronic drum beat that has characteristics resembling an acoustic drum kit. The atmosphere is sentimental and vibrant. This piece could be used in advertisement jingles. It could be playing in the background in a romantic setting."
