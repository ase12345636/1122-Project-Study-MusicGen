    "caption": "This is a breakbeat piece. There is a groovy electronic drum beat providing the rhythmic structure. A medium pitched pad is playing a repeated theme. There is a synth bass in the background. Occasional string stab hits can be heard. This piece could fit well in the soundtracks of crime movies taking place in the city and car racing video games."
