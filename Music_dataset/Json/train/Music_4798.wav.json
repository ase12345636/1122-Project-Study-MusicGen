    "caption": "This is the recording of a latin dance music piece. It has a male vocalist singing the same word repeatedly at a medium-to-high pitch. There is an accordion playing the melody and a bass guitar in the background. The electronic drums play a latin beat for the rhythm. There is a constant rising and accelerating pattern in the piece. The sound of people shouting can be heard in the recording. The atmosphere is very loud and vibrant."
