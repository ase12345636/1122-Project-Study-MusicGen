    "caption": "This is a live performance by an African music group in a gospel style. The drum pattern is intricate and there are other percussive elements like an occasional bongo and a wooden percussion instrument. The melodic elements are the vintage sounding electric piano  as well as the vibrant and fun brass melody played on the trumpets."
