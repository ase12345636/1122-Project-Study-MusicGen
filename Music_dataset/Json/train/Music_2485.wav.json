    "caption": "This is the live performance of a Mexican folk music piece. In the beginning, there is a female voice giving an introductory speech in the Spanish language. Then, the arpa jarocha (which is a Mexican harp) and the ukulele start playing a lively and relaxed tune. The atmosphere is vibrant. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a Mexican soap opera during scenes of calmer temperament."
