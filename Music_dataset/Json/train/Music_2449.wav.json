    "caption": "This song contains three guitars playing chords, and two melodies while one of the guitars stands out to be playing the main melody. The guitars are panned to the left and the right side of the speakers. An e-bass is playing a walking line that repeats itself. Different percussive instruments are panned to the left and right side of the speakers. There are some noises of doors opening and closing that I think do not belong to the musical composition and they sound in the foreground. This song may be playing in a house in the countryside."
