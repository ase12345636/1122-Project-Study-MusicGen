    "caption": "The low quality recording features an electro song that consists of acid aggressive synth melody, repetitive synth lead melody, boomy 808 bass, claps and shimmering hi-hats. There is a sizzling riser in the first section of the loop. It sounds energetic and like something you would hear in an underground club."
