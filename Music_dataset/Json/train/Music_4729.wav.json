    "caption": "This slow rock song starts with an acoustic guitar playing chords in fingerstyle. For each chord, a pedal bass note is played while the higher pitch notes are played in a repeated sequence of three notes being played one after the other. A male voice sings the main melody. There are no other instruments in this song. This song can be played in a movie scene where a car is driving across a deserted highway."
