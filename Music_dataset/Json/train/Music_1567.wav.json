    "caption": "This is the live performance of a reggae piece. There is a female vocalist in the lead singing melodically. The keyboard can be heard playing the main melody. The bass guitar is playing a simple but groovy bass line. In the rhythmic background, there is a slow tempo acoustic drum beat. The atmosphere is emotional. This is an amateur recording and a bit dated, so the audio quality is quite poor."
