    "caption": "This is a low quality recording of a rock song. The main lead melody is sung by a male voice. Other male voices sing vocables in the background in between lines. A string ensemble plays fills in the background with an ascending lick in between lines. The percussion plays a simple rock beat in common time with snare strokes on every alternate count. The bass plays the root notes of the chords. The mood of this song is motivational. Other instruments cannot be identified due to the low audio quality. This song can be played at the end credits of a superhero movie."
