    "caption": "A male singer sings this  Telugu folk song. The tempo pop is medium  with a tambourine, tabla and other south Indian percussion playing steadily, along with string instrument harmony. The song is a folk tune and probably a courtship song. The song has loud sound effects which are funny. The audio quality is poor."
