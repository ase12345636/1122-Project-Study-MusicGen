    "caption": "The low quality recording features a reggae/dub song that consists of a flat male vocal singing over punchy 808 bass, punchy snare, shimmering hi hats and groovy piano chords. It sounds energetic, groovy and the recording is noisy and in mono - due to the fact that the sound is coming from the right channel only."
