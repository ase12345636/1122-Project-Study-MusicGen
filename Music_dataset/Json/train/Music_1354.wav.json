    "caption": "The low quality recording features a folk song that consists of loud passionate male vocal singing over acoustic guitar melody, shimmering shakers, percussive bongos, \"4 on the floor\" kick and mellow pad chords. It sounds loud, dull, messy and muffled, since the frequencies are clashing. It also sounds traditional and emotional."
