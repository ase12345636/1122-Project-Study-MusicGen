    "caption": "An acoustic drum is playing a fast groove with a kick-hit on every beat. The snare hit is full of reverb and panned to the right side of the speaker. A loud e-bass is playing a melody along with a clean e-guitar. A piano is playing a chord progression also adding a rhythmic element to the song. The male voice is singing in the mid range and gets support from backing voices that are barely noticeable. This song may be playing at a headshop."
