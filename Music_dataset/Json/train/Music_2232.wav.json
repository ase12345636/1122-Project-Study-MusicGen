    "caption": "The low quality recording features a Chiptune music that consists of a high pitched vocal singing over groovy synth keys, synth lead melody, laser synth effects, punchy kick, claps, shimmering hi hats and groovy synth bass. It sounds energetic, fun, happy and joyful - like something kids would listen to."
