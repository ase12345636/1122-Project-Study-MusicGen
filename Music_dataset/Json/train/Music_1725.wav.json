    "caption": "This song is full of fast paced rhythm being played by percussion and a drumset. An e-guitar is playing a fast repeating melody with little changes along with an e-piano playing chords and melody. The e-bass is playing a groove along with the drums that sounds inviting to dance along. In the background you can hear voices cheering. This song may be playing live."
