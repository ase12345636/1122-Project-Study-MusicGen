    "caption": "This is a Mexican folk music piece. The main theme is played by a marimba. There is a bass guitar in the background. The acoustic drums and the latin percussion provide the rhythmic background for the piece. It has a very playful atmosphere. The music could definitely be used in a children's movie/TV show or an advertisement targeted at kids."
