    "caption": "The Gospel song features a choir singing over shimmering cymbals, soft hi-hats, smooth bass, arpeggiated acoustic guitar melody, sustained strings melody and emotional piano chords. It sounds passionate and heartfelt as the instrumentation is played dynamically, as the listener can really feel the softness of the instruments."
