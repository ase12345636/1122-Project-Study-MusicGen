    "caption": "This children's song features a male voice singing the main melody. Other voices sing vocables in harmony in the beginning and after the lyrics are sung. This is accompanied by percussion playing a fast beat. The bass plays the root notes of the chords. A synth plays an ascending lick with the vocables in the beginning. When the words are sung, the synth plays the same melody as the main voice. This is a moderate tempo song. The mood of this song is happy. This song can be sung in a children's action movie."
