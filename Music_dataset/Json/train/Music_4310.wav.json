    "caption": "This is a pop music piece with 80s characteristics. There is a female vocalist in the lead singing melodically. The main theme is played by a keyboard and an electric guitar at the same time in the major scale. There is a bass guitar and a medium-to-high range pad in the background. The rhythmic background is provided by a loud but simple acoustic drum beat. There is a maximalist, vibrant and energetic atmosphere. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a romance movie. It could also fit very nicely as the soundtrack of an anime."
