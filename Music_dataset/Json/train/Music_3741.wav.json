    "caption": "This song contains a lot of atmospheric noise, sounds rising and falling in velocity and panning to the left and right side of the speakers with a lot of reverb. A high pitched pluck sound is playing a faster melody that is slightly panned to the right side while digital drums are only playing hihat and light snare sounds panned to both sides of the speakers and using a lot of delay and reverb. This song may be playing in a scary videogame."
