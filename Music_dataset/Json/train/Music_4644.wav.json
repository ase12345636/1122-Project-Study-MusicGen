    "caption": "This is an indie folk music piece. There is a melancholic melody being played by the banjo and the trombone, then they both stop and the organ can be heard holding a note. The atmosphere is sentimental. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a drama, especially during the scenes where people are mourning the loss of a character."
