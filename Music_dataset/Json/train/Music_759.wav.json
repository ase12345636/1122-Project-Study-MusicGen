    "caption": "This is a country/Americana music piece. There is a male vocalist with a gravelly voice singing in the lead. An acoustic guitar is playing a simple tune. There is a faint percussive element that can be heard in the background that resembles pinched harmonics coming from a guitar. The atmosphere is melancholic. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a drama movie or a TV show during a scene of introspection where a character is experiencing dark thoughts."
