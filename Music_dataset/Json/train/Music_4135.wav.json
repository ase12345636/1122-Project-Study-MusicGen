    "caption": "This is an amateur recording of a boy singing along to a kids song playing on a TV. It is an educational song with a female voice in the lead. The melody is being played by an acoustic guitar while the rhythm is played by the electronic drums. The quality of the recording is quite poor. Samples lifted from this recording could still be useful in beat-making."
