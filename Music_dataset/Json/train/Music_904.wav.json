    "caption": "This is a modern classical instrumental piece. The melody is played by an orchestra with the strings section as the lead, the piano playing an arpeggio and the bass guitar carrying the background. There is a light percussive element resembling a tambourine keeping the rhythmic background. The piece has a melodic, story-telling mood to it which would make it the perfect choice to use in a movie soundtrack, especially a romantic movie."
