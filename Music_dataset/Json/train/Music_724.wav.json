    "caption": "This instrumental song starts off with a repetitive synth melody and percussion. The percussion pauses and the sound of water splash is heard. The bass note continues to ring. During this pause, a three-note high pitched game sound is played. After the pause, the synth melody continues to play and a piano melody is played on top of that. The bass plays the root notes of the chords. The percussion plays a simple beat in common time."
