    "caption": "The drums and the e-bass are creating a reggae groove together with the e-guitar that is playing on the offbeat and with a lot of ping pong delay that is jumping back and forth on both sides of the speakers. The male voice is singing and a shaker is playing panned to the right side of the speakers. This song may be playing at an alternative vegan restaurant with an outside terrace."
