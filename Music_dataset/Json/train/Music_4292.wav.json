    "caption": "This hard rock song feels like the kind of song that would play as you are preparing to go to war. The instruments are gritty, grungy, and intense. The electric guitarist plays an intricate motif and the bass player matches the main part of the riff. The drummer plays potent and punchy rhythms which feature the crash cymbal - which adds a bright shimmery contrast to the dark and grungry guitars."
