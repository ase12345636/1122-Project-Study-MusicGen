    "caption": "This is the amateur recording of an instrument showcase jam. There is a didgeridoo playing at low-to-medium range making various resonant sounds in the process. The atmosphere is ominous and tribal. The quality of the audio is quite poor. This piece could be played at a primary school music class to give the kids an impression of how a didgeridoo sounds like."
