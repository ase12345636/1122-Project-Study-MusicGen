    "caption": "This is the live performance of a Huayno folk music piece which belongs to the Andean region. There is a female vocalist singing at a high-pitch, almost at a screeching range. The tune is being played by a violin and an Andean/Peruvian harp. The atmosphere is eccentric. This piece could be playing from a radio in a movie taking place in a mountainous Latin American village."
