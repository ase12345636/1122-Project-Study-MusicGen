    "caption": "The low quality recording features a pop song sung by flat female vocalists singing over sustained strings melody, smooth bass, punchy snare, soft kick hits and simple hi hats. It sounds distorted and messy, since the frequencies are clashing with each other due to the bad mix. It also sounds a bit repetitive."
