    "caption": "The Metal song features wide aggressive distorted electric guitars, punchy kick and snare hits, energetic crash cymbals, simple hi hats, groovy bass guitar, sustained synth pad melody and passionate female vocals singing over it. It sounds energetic, powerful, manic and aggressive - especially in the first part of the loop where there is a drum break."
