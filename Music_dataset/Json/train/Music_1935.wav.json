    "caption": "This is a dancehall music piece. There is a male vocalist singing with a Jamaican accent. An electric guitar and a bass guitar are playing the melody in the background while occasional keyboard notes can be heard. The rhythmic background is provided by the mild tempo basic 4/4 played on the acoustic drums. There is an echo delay effect on the snare drum every now and then. The atmosphere of the piece is chill and groovy. This piece could be playing through loudspeakers at a beach. It could also suit well at a summer barbecue party."
