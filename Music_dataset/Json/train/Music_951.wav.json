    "caption": "This classic rock song features a hammond organ playing the main melody. This is backed by the percussion playing a simple beat. The percussion plays the hi-hat at every count and ends with a roll at the end of every bar. The bass plays the same melody as the hammond. There are no voices in this song. This is an instrumental song. This song can be played in a bank robbery scene in a movie."
