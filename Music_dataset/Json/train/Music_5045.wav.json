    "caption": "Male voices are yodeling with a lot of reverb on their voices. They are loud and the speakers of the recording are speaking. An accordion is playing a fast melody that is panned to the right side of the speakers. A guitar is strumming a rhythmic chord on the backbeat. An upright bass is playing a walking bassline. This song may be playing at a folksfest. This is an amateur recording."
