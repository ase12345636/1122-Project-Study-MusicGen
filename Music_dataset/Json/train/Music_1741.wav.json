    "caption": "Two female singers sing this delightful vocal duet in harmony. They make funny animated vocal effects like yodelling  and funny animal noises. The song is medium fast tempo with a guitar accompaniment and no percussion. The song is cheerful and story telling in nature. The song is a vintage pop song with bad audio quality."
