    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a mellow classical piano melody and sustained passionate violin melody playing together. It is very noisy and there are some crackling noises, widely spread in the background. Sounds passionate, emotional and it seems like it was recorded with one stereo pair of microphones."
