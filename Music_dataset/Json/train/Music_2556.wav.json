    "caption": "The low quality recording features an indie song that consists of a mellow piano melody, punchy kick and snare hits, wide toms and shimmering hi-hats. As the kick is leaning to the left and the snare to the right - it makes the stereo image unbalanced. Overall it sounds groovy, suspenseful and reverberant."
