    "caption": "The low quality recording features a blues song that consists of throaty male vocals, alongside harmonizing male vocals, singing over electric guitar melody, brass melody, shimmering hi hats, punchy snare and kick hits and walking double bass. It is a bit noisy and it sounds funky, groovy, happy, fun and vintage - like something you would want to dance to."
