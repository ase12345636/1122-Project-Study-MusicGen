    "caption": "The low quality recording features a wide, soft whispering male vocals singing over a wide electric guitar melody, shimmering cymbals and drum roll. In the second part of the loop there is an energetic male vocal singing over more energetic electric guitar chords, distorted bass, punchy kick and snare hits and shimmering cymbals. It sounds energetic, aggressive, but also messy and kind of chaotic, since the mix is dirty."
