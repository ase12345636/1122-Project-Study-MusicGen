    "caption": "The low quality recording features a song that consists of harmonized children vocals singing over bouncy snare, saxophone solo melody, groovy bass, shimmering open hats and \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern. There are some laughing, high pitched tire screeches and car engine sound effects in the background. The recording is very noisy and the song is quiet and thin, as it lacks bass frequencies, but it still sounds fun and happy - like something you would hear in TV shows for kids."
