    "caption": "This is a live performance of a pop rock music piece. Two male vocals are singing melodically at the same time. There is a piano playing an upbeat melody while the bass guitar plays a simple bass line in the background. The piece has a joyful aura to it. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a sit-com during the scenes of a character happily walking through the city."
