    "caption": "This song contains digital drums playing a simple groove along with two guitars. One strumming chords along with the snare the other one playing a melody on top. An e-bass is playing the footnote while a piano is playing a major and minor chord progression. A trumpet is playing a loud melody alongside the guitar. All the instruments sound flat and are being played by a keyboard. There are little bongo hits in the background panned to the left side of the speakers. Apart from the music you can hear eating sounds and a stomach rumbling. This song may be playing for an advertisement."
