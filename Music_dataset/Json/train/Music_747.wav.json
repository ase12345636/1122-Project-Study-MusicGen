    "caption": "The music features a girlish female voice singing a sparse melody. The bass guitar and drums drive the pulse of the music but the drums play a more active role in that regard. Towards the middle of the music excerpt a crescendo leading into an orchestra hit can be heard. After this, a calming synth pad sound can be heard providing harmonic context."
