    "caption": "The song sounds orchestrated. There  is a string section playing swells and rising tremolos along to an acoustic piano playing minor chords. A cello is playing long low notes on top of that a saxophone is playing two notes to end the phrase. A deep and far percussive hit comes in every fourth count. The female singer's voice sounds sensitive and melancholic. There are female backing voices singing along. The whole composition is full of big reverb. This song may be playing at the end of a sad movie."
