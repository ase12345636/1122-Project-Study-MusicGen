    "caption": "This is a live acoustic performance piece. The didgeridoo is being used in varying ranges and effects to play many different tunes and to get a techno-like sound variety. There is a whole bunch of percussive instruments being used from membranous percussion to bell percussion. It all adds up into one big sensational performance. There is an eccentric atmosphere. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a movie with a primitive/jungle setting. It could also be used in action or pursuit scenes in movies."
