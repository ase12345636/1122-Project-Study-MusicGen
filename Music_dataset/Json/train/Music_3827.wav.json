    "caption": "The rock music features a screaming male voice singing a melody. One of the electric guitars accompanies the singer with strummed chords while the other, for the second part of the music excerpt, plays a melody. Both guitars have a distortion effect on. The drums play a well grounded rhythm and together with the bass guitar drive the pulse of the music. The quality of the audio recording is not that good, most probably this is an old live recording."
