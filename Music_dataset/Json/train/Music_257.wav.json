    "caption": "This song contains an accordion playing a fast melody along with a female voice singing her own melody with a lot of vibrato and sliding down tones. A tabla is playing a rhythm. Everybody seems  to make their own thing. So this can be considered a complex composition. This song may be playing live with people listening and sitting on the floor."
