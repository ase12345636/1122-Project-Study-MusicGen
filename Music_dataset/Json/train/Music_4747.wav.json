    "caption": "The low quality recording features a pop song that consists of groovy synth keys, punchy snare and kick hits, simple hi hats, shimmering open hats, smooth sub bass, arpeggiated echoing synth lead and wide synth pad chords. It sounds energetic and a bit repetitive - like something you would hear in a TV commercial, as background music."
