    "caption": "This is an excerpt from a dubbed anime. There is a male voice speaking in a funny manner. Then, a dramatic orchestra piece starts playing to imply something is about to happen. The brass section and the timpani are playing a rising pattern until a sneeze and hissing sounds can be heard. There is a peculiar feel to this track. Parts of it could be sampled for use in beat-making."
