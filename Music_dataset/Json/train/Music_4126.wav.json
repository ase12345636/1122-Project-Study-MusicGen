    "caption": "This heavy metal song features a male voice singing the main melody. The song starts with male voices singing 'hey, hey'. This is accompanied by aggressive percussion playing a rock beat. A distortion guitar is playing lead fills and another distortion guitar playing power chords. The bass plays the root notes of the chords. Another voice comes in and is screaming at a high pitch. This is accompanied by continuous snare hits for 8 bars. The main voice starts singing at this time and is accompanied by rock percussion. The bass plays the same root notes once again and the distortion guitar plays a riff in the background. The other guitar continues to play lead fills. The mood of this song is defiant. This song can be played in a rebel themed movie."
