    "caption": "This song starts off with 2 heartbeats. The sound of a knife being honed is played. After this, we hear a short blasting sound. This is followed by a fast paced percussion starting off with a roll and then playing -two strokes on a hi-hat and one stroke on the snare drum. A male voice speaks in a narrative voice with a distortion guitar playing power chords in the background. The rest of the instruments continue playing in the background while the voice is narrating."
