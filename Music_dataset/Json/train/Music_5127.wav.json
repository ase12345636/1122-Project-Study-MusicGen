    "caption": "This is an amateur recording of a harmonica solo being performed over a blues/rock-n-roll music piece. The piece is instrumental. The harmonica plays a melodic solo in the style of blues. The backing track consists of the electric guitar and the bass guitar playing a simple tune while the medium tempo acoustic drums are playing a basic blues rock beat. The atmosphere is easygoing. This piece could be playing from the radio during a road trip in a movie."
