    "caption": "The low quality recording features an electro song that consists of a reverberant \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern, followed by suspenseful synth stabs. At the very end of the loop there is a short riser, after which comes the snippet of a filtered synth bass. It sounds thin, as it was poorly mixed."
