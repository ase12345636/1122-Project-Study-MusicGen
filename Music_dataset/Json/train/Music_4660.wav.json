    "caption": "This is a Christian rock piece. There is a male vocalist in the lead singing gently and melodically. A mild-tempered electric guitar is playing the main theme. There is a bass guitar holding the root notes. The rhythmic background is provided by the acoustic drums. This song has a mellow and hopeful atmosphere. Due to being religious in nature, this piece could be played in the background of Christian religious content. It could also be played at Christian religious events."
