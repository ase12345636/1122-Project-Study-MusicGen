The tempo is fast with bright drumming, intense electric guitar feedback, keyboard harmony and rhythmic acoustic guitar with vocal backup. The song is upbeat, spirited, enthusiastic, vibrant, vivacious, buoyant and youthful with a dance groove. The sound quality is inferior making it difficult to understand the lyrics or the finer elements of this Rock and Roll song."
