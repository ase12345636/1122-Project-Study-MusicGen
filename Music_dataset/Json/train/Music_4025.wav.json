    "caption": "This is a loud heavy metal piece that is played as a soundtrack for a video game with sound effects of fire and a dinosaur roaring in the beginning. There is a distorted electric guitar playing a simple tune while loud acoustic drums provide a heavy metal beat as the rhythmic background. The theme has a very violent feel to it."
