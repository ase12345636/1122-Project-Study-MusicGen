    "caption": "This Regional Mexican song features a live recording of a male voice singing the main melody. The song starts with the cymbal played once and held so that it does not ring. Then the male voice sings one line with the crowd. The crowd shouts out in joy after a line is sung. The bass is played on a tuba. This is followed by trumpets playing a high pitched melody. This song is at a slow tempo. Apart from the initial cymbal sound, no other percussion is played. This song can be played in a romantic movie."
