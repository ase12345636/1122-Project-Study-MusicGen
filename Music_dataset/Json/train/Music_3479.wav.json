    "caption": "A male voice is singing loud and soulful while a e-bass takes the major role of the instrumental serving with a percussive rhythm along with a e-guitar strumming short chords where a snare could have been. Male backing vocals singing harmonies in the background. The recording sounds old and therefore not of the best quality. This song may be playing while eating a romantic dinner with your partner."
