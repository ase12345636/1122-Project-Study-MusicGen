    "caption": "This is a reggae/dub music piece. There is a fat sounding bass guitar playing a groovy bass line. An electric guitar with heavy delay and reverb effects is playing a vague tune. There is a reggae acoustic drum beat in the rhythmic background. The atmosphere is trippy. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a movie during scenes where a character would be under the influence of substances."
