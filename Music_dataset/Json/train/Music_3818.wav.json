    "caption": "This is a dancehall/reggae music piece. There is a female vocalist singing in a rap-like manner with a Jamaican accent in the lead. The melody is being played by two layers of electric guitar with a bass guitar backing. The rhythm is being played by the electronic drums. An airy synth sound can be heard very faintly in the distance. The atmosphere is chill. This piece can be used in the soundtrack of a summer movie during scenes where everybody is relaxing."
