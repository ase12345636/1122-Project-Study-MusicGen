    "caption": "This song is a low quality live recording of a performance. This features a male voice singing the main melody. At the end of the song, other voices sing with the main voice in harmony. This is accompanied by an electric guitar plucking chords. The double bass plays the root notes of the chords. The percussion plays the cymbal, increasing volume slowly, giving it a swell feel. The mood of the song seems romantic."
