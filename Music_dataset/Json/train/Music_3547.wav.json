    "caption": "This is a glam rock/classic rock music piece. There is a male vocalist singing melodically. The main theme is being played by the electric guitar while the bass guitar is playing in the background. The rhythm is provided by a rock acoustic drum beat. There is a loud vinyl hiss because of how aged the record is. The atmosphere is groovy. This piece could be playing in the background of a rock bar."
