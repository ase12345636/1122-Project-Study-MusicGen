    "caption": "This is a symphonic orchestra playing  a piece that's riveting, thrilling and exciting. The peace would be suitable in a movie when something grand and impressive happens. There are clarinets, tubas, trumpets and french horns being played. The brass instruments help create that sense of a momentous occasion. The percussion is done on timpanis and a cymbal."
