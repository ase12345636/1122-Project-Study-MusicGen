    "caption": "This is a pop music piece. The words are being sung by two vocals: one male and one female which lead to a duet for the chorus. There is a banjo and an electric guitar playing the melody while a simple electronic drum beat provides the rhythmic background for the song. It is a slightly melodic and emotional song. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a romantic drama during a flashback scene."
