    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a rock song and it features a passionate male vocal singing over groovy double bass, acoustic rhythm guitar, plucked violin melody and simple piano chords. It sounds reverberant, emotional, groovy and smooth - like something you would sing along to at the concert."
