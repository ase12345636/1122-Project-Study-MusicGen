    "caption": "This is a low quality audio recording. It starts with a DJ console scratching a record. This is accompanied by programmed percussion playing a repetitive melody. A berimbau plays after the scratching sound and the percussion continues to play the same beat. The berimbau plays the string as well as adds to the beat in the song. This is an instrumental song and there are no voices. This song can be played in a fashion show."
