The melody is being played by the electric guitar and the keyboard guitar with the bass guitar in the background. The rhythm is provided by the acoustic drums with occasional clap sounds. The atmosphere is easygoing and danceable. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a sit-com movie or a TV show."
