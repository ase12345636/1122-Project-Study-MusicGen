    "caption": "The Electro song features a harmonizing passionate male vocals, with widely spread and dynamic echo effect on it, singing over groovy bass, groovy piano chords, synth keys and filtered \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern. It sounds exciting, easygoing and addictive - like something you would hear in a DJ set as a warm up."
