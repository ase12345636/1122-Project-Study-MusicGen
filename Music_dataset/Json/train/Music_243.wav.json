    "caption": "This is a Malaysian alternative rock music piece. There is a male vocalist singing melodically at the forefront. The main melody is played by the acoustic guitar with the backing of a mellow electric guitar and a simple bass line on the bass guitar. The rhythmic background consists of a basic rock acoustic drum beat. There is a sentimental and easygoing atmosphere to this piece. It could be used in the soundtrack of a drama/romance movie or TV series that takes place in Malaysia."
