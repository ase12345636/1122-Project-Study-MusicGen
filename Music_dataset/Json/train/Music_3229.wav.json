The keyboard and the electric guitar are playing in the melodic background. The rhythmic background consists of a medium tempo electronic drum beat. The atmosphere is groovy. There is an interesting feel to it. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a cartoon or an animation movie. It could also work well as a background music for intriguing social media content."
