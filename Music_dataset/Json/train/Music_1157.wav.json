    "caption": "This blues song features a male voice singing the main melody at a comfortable pitch. This is accompanied by percussion playing a simple rock beat in common time. An overdriven guitar plays a blues riff. After one bar, the guitar and bass pause while the percussion and voice continues. The bass plays the root notes of the chords. The mood of this song is happy. This song can be played in a bar scene in a movie."
