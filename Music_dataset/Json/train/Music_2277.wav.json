    "caption": "This song contains someone playing a melody on a flute panning to the right side of the speakers. A lower synth drone pad is underlining the flute along with more synth pad sounds and wind. Then a soft riser comes in and a digital drum starts playing along to a synth bass sound. This song may be playing in an indie movie."
