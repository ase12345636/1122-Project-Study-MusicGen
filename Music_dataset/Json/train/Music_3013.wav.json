    "caption": "This orchestral music features violins playing the main melody using staccato notes. The volume of the violins increases over time in the song. The bass plays a booming note on the alternate count of every bar. The bass resonates like a heartbeat. A single percussion beat is played on the second count of the second bar. There is the sound of a victory chant in the background. This song is at a slow tempo. This song can be used in the trailer of an epic movie."
