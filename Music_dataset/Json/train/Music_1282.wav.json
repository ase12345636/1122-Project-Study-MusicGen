    "caption": "This is a vocal performance from a soap opera soundtrack. There is a female vocalist that is singing with a heavily manipulated voice, most probably through the use of a vocoder. The volume of the track is unnecessarily loud and it peaks frequently. There is an unsettling atmosphere. It could be used in the soundtrack of a horror movie where the protagonist is slowly losing touch with reality."
