    "caption": "The low quality recording features an electro song that consists of flat male vocals, alongside widely spread male barking onomatopoeia, singing over shimmering shakers, sizzling triangle, tinny cowbell, punchy kick, punchy snare and groovy bass. It sounds energetic and addictive, even though it is a bit repetitive."
