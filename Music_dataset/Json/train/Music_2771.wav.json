    "caption": "This techno song features a female voice singing only in non-lexical vocables. This is accompanied by programmed percussion. The percussion pauses after one and a half bars. It plays again after half a bar in an eighth note pattern. A synth plays a melody that is the same as that of the voice. The melody is repetitive. This song has a happy mood. This song can be played in a club."
