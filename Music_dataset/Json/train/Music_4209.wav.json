    "caption": "The Metal song features a screaming male vocal singing repetitive lyrics over distorted bass, aggressive electric guitar riff, punchy snare and kick hits, energetic cymbals and modulated acid synth lead melody. In the first half of the loop, there is a filter effect, that builds the tension before the bass drops. It sounds manic, aggressive and energetic, like something you would listen to while jumping in the mosh pit."
