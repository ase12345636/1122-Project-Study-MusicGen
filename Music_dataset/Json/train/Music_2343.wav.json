    "caption": "This is a bluegrass music piece. The acoustic guitar follows an offbeat strumming pattern, providing a rhythmic background. The violin and the banjo take turns to play rapid, upbeat solos. The atmosphere is very lively. This piece could be used at a definitively American setting such as a rodeo venue."
