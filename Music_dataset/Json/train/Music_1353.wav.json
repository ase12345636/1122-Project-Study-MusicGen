    "caption": "A female voice is singing loud and in a high key. Her voice is full of reverb and a little delay. It is so loud that the speakers are speaking a lot. There are percussive instruments like chimes and tabla like sounds playing a rhythm while a flute is playing a melody in the background. This is an amateur recording with poor recording quality. This song may be playing at a local dance event."
