    "caption": "This is a live recording of a guitar being played through a high gain amp. The signal is clean at the beginning and switches to an overdrive or distortion tone. A humming noise is heard when the channel is switched to the distortion channel. There are no other instruments played in this clip apart from one guitar. The guitarist seems to be testing the clean and dirty channels of the guitar amplifier."
