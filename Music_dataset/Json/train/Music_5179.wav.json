    "caption": "The low quality recording features an Alternative/Indie song playing in the background while there are some skateboarding sound effects and foley in front. It is obviously a skateboarding compilation video. The song consists of groovy bass, energetic drums, wide synth key chords and wide synth pad chords, while the harmonizing female vocals are singing on top of it. It sounds fun and happy."
