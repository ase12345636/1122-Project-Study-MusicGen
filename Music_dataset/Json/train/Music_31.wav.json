    "caption": "This is a drum & bass music piece. There is a constantly repeating hollering sample accompanied by rapid turntable scratching. A synth sound can be heard playing an ominous tune. The rhythmic background consists of a fast-tempo electronic drum beat. The atmosphere is energetic. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a car racing game. It could also be playing at nightclubs during early-2000s themed parties."
