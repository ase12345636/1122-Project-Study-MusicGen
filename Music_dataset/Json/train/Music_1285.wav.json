This is accompanied by percussion playing a simple melody in common time. The bass plays a rock and roll bassline. The keyboard plays chords and fills using a piano tone. An acoustic guitar plays chords. A voice from the crowd sings a quirky sound at the beginning of the second bar. This song can be used in a retro movie in a music festival or carnival scene."
