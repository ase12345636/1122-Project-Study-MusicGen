    "caption": "The electronic music features a section that repeats roughly every two seconds. It consists of a beat that's made of a kick drum and claps. A buzzing synth sets the pulsation of the music by playing once every two beats. The whole music sounds like a loop being played over and over. Towards the end of the excerpt a crescendo-like buzzing sound can be heard, increasing the tension."
