    "caption": "The Low quality recording features an upbeat instrumental playing in the background on some kind of speaker, while a loud marimba melody is played over it. It kind of sounds off beat, also the sound is mostly located in the left channel of the stereo image, which makes the recording imbalanced and low in quality."
