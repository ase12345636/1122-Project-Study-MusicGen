    "caption": "The drums are playing a funky groove together with the e-bass. An almost clean e-guitar is playing an additional melody in the background. A male and female voice are singing together accompanied by a string section in the background while a brass section is giving short and strong responses as a buildup and breakingpoint. This song may be playing at a veny-shop."
