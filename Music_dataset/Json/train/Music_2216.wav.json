    "caption": "This is a classical music piece played with the virtual sounds of a wind orchestra. The orchestra is composed of the oboe, the clarinet, the basset horn, the bassoon and the contrabass. The piece is in major key which gives the piece a more positive aura in general, but the virtual sounds make it feel inauthentic."
