    "caption": "The song sounds epic and is fully orchestrated with a string section; brass section; a male choir in the background, fast timpani hits and strings playing a melody. When the song stops, a door knocking sound can be heard along with a short video-game music sequence that does not belong to the previous song. The first song may be playing in a movie trailer."
