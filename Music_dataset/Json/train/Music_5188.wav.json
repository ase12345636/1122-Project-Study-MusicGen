    "caption": "This is a home recording of two electric guitar players jamming some random rock/metal tunes. It is a dated amateur recording so the quality is quite poor. The electric guitars have a distortion effect that gives them a crunchy sound. The sound is hard-hitting, but the atmosphere feels spontaneous and random. Parts of this recording could be lifted as distorted electric guitar samples to be used in beat-making."
