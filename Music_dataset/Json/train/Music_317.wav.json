    "caption": "The low quality recording features clapping and shoe tapping sounds over rock songs played on playback. The song consists of a passionate male vocal that sings over punchy kick and snare hits, shimmering hi hats, electric guitar melody and groovy bass guitar. The recording is in mono and a bit noisy, as it was probably recorded with a phone."
