    "caption": "A hard digital kick is playing along with a monotone bass sound. A malled instrument is playing a repetitive melody in the mid to high register. Evolving liquid synth sounds are rising into focus and up in pitch then a male voice sample comes in before the drum breaks into a new part with a snare sound. This may be playing at a rave in the woods."
