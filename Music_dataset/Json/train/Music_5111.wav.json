    "caption": "This folk song starts off with a female voice singing the main melody. The voice has the added effect of autotune. This is accompanied by a rebab or a bowed instrument playing the same melody as the voice. Another stringed instrument is plucked, playing the same melody as the voice. The bass plays the root notes of the chords. The voice rests and other instruments come in. A clarinet plays a descending fill. Koboro percussion is played giving this song a middle-eastern feel. This song has a happy feel. It is a fusion between a folk song and a more modern beat. This song can be played as a party song."
