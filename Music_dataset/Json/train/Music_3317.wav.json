    "caption": "Someone is playing a track from speakers. This song contains a strong e-bass playing a funky bassline along with a funky drum groove. Then a piano comes in playing a jazzy melody in one scale accompanied by a synth brass sound swelling into existence and playing a short rise before leaving again. This is an amateur recording but of decent audio-quality. This song may be playing in a jazzbar."
