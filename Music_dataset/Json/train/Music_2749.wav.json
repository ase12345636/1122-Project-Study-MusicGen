    "caption": "This is a hip-hop/dancehall music piece. There is a repeating female vocal sample in the lead. The piano is playing the chords of the song. There is a groovy bass guitar in the background. The rhythm is provided by an acoustic drum beat with a lot of rhythmic sound effects applied to give it more of a swing feel. The atmosphere of the piece is chill and urban. This piece could be the opening theme of a sit-com taking place in the big city."
