    "caption": "The low quality recording features an experimental song that consists of wide synth pad chords, wide echoing & shimmering hi hats and filtered echoing acid bass melody that slowly fade in, in the second half of the loop. There are also some subtle crackles, as the recording is a bit noisy. It sounds mystical, hypnotic and haunting."
