    "caption": "This is an electronic piece played in an instructive video. A sine wave synth sound is used both in the chords and the lead section. It is in medium-to-high range. There is a bizarre feeling in this piece. Although the piece is interrupted in the original, parts of it can be lifted to be used as samples in the soundtrack of an outer space sci-fi movie/video game."
