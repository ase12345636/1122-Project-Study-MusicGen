    "caption": "The low quality recording features a hip hop beat and some skateboard sound effects in the background. The beat consists of female opera vocalists that sing over punchy snare and kick hits, simple hi hats, energetic crash cymbals, simple piano chords, smooth bass and sustained strings melody. It sounds epic and powerful, almost inspiring. The stereo image is unbalanced, since the snare hits are panned a bit to the right channel, and overall the left channel is a bit louder."
