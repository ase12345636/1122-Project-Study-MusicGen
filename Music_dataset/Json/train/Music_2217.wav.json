    "caption": "This salsa song features a female voice singing the main melody. This is accompanied by percussion on a drum kit as well as on a congo. The congo gives this song the salsa feel. The drum kit plays the cowbell and high pitched snare drum to add more of the salsa vibe. The bass plays groovy fills. Trumpets, trombones and saxophones play fills in between lines. They play in harmony. A piano plays jazzy chords in the background. This song can be played in a dance club for a salsa night."
