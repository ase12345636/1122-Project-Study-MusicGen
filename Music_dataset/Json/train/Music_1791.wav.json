    "caption": "The low quality recording features an afrobeats song played on speaker in a medium size room, and it consists at least syncopated rimshots, shimmering open hats, synth keys melody, groovy bass, repetitive male vocal melody and harmonizing vocals layered with it. Even though the recording is noisy, thin, messy and in mono, it still sounds groovy and like something you would want to dance to."
