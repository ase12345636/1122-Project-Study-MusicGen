There is a piano playing chords in a syncopated manner. The bass guitar is playing a groovy bass line. The rhythmic background consists of an acoustic jazz drum beat. The atmosphere is dreamy and cheerful. This piece could be playing in the soundtrack of an animation movie during a dream sequence."
