    "caption": "The R&B song features a passionate male vocalist singing over a wide funky electric guitar melody, smooth bass guitar, punchy kick and snare hits, shimmering hi hats, snappy rimshots and soft crash cymbals. The rimshots are present in the first half of the loop, while a more energetic second part of the loop consists of punchy snare hits. It sounds emotional and heartfelt, as the vocal is slightly distorted."
