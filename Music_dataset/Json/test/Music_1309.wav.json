    "caption": "The epic music excerpt starts off full force with an orchestral ensemble playing loud blocks of sound. The taiko drums play with the same rhythm the orchestra does. After a few seconds the volume is dialed down and one can hear a melody being created from electronic sounds and possibly a bass guitar. In the background a metallic percussive instrument is being played with bare hands."
