    "caption": "The low quality recording features an electro song that consists of a punchy \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern, shimmering hi hats, mellow claps, repetitive synth bass, short snare roll, subtle synth bells melody and loud synth lead melody. Even though it is thin, it is still something you would hear as an energetic track in a club."
