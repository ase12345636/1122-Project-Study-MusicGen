    "caption": "A full sounding male voice is singing mid range with kind of a radio effect on his voice. Two banjos are strumming chords with one playing the lead melody on top. One is panned to the right side of the speakers. An acoustic drum is playing a four on the floor groove with a kick on every beat and an e-bass is playing his own melody along. In the background you can hear the sound of a photo taken. This song may be playing in an advertisement for a product."
