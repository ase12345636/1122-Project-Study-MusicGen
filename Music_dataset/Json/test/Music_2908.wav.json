    "caption": "This song contains a piano playing minor chords with a lot of reverb, a synthesizer playing a countermelody with short notes and something like a processed and cut voice sample that gets repeated in a very short and rhythmical ways serving as percussive element and is panned to the left and the right side of the speakers along with white noise processed with delay. For a moment a short digital bass sound is coming in. This song may be playing in a club."
