    "caption": "This song contains a drum set playing a groove with an outstanding snare hit and hihats panned to the right side of the speakers. Synthesizer pad sounds are rising up in pitch to the mid range. The recording also contains something like a short sniffing sound used as part of the rhythm and sound effects. This song may be playing in a thriller-movie."
