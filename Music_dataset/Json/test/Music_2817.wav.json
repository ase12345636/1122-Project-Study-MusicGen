    "caption": "An acoustic drum is playing a faster groove along with a bassline and a harmonica playing a chord on the offbeat and in a lower key. A e-guitar is playing a melody in the mid range. There are some background noises that remind me of someone brushing his/her teeth. This song may be playing live at a bar."
