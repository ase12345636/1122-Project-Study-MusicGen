    "caption": "Here we have an electronic dance song that is building up to a crescendo moment. We hear a synth sound that is almost  like a combination between a wood percussion instrument and the sound of water droplets. The sound has reverb applied to it, and speeds up towards the end as the song builds up. We hear a riser sound effect as well."
