    "caption": "This is a Christian gospel music piece. There is a male vocalist singing melodically in the lead. The tune is being played by the acoustic guitar and the piano while the bass guitar is following with the root notes. The rhythm is played with brushes on the acoustic drums. The atmosphere is mellow. This piece could be playing in the background at Christian religious events."
