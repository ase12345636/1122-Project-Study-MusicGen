    "caption": "This is an amateur recording of a latin dance music piece. The audio quality is not that great. There is a male vocalist singing loudly. A bass guitar is playing a groovy bass line while an electric guitar is strumming chords in a syncopated manner. The rhythmic background is provided by a barely heard latin acoustic drum beat. The atmosphere is cheerful. This piece could be sampled for use in the making of a latin influenced hip-hop beat."
