    "caption": "This is an experimental electronica piece. There are various synth sounds, some at medium range and most at high range. There is a disorganized, chaotic feel to this piece. It carries an atmosphere of randomness that can be most optimistically classified as avant-garde. This piece could be used in horror movies and video games to signify a separation from reality."
