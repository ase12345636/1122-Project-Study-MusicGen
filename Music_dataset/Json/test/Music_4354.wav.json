    "caption": "This is the live performance of a bluegrass music piece. There are male vocals singing together in a lively manner. There are two banjos playing the melody, one acting as the lead and the other as the rhythm. There is also an acoustic guitar following the banjos. An upright bass is playing the bass line which acts as a rhythmic background. The general atmosphere of the piece is very uplifting. The piece can be used in the soundtrack of rural comedies. It could also be used in the background for funny social media content."
