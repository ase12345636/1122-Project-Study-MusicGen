    "caption": "This song contains two different e-pianos playing melodies panned to the left and right side of the speakers. Two synthesizers are playing a tone that sounds like pulsating electricity and the other one a pad sound in a higher key. A e-bassline is playing together with the acoustic drum that is holding a steady groove without many changes. On top of that a male voice is singing in a higher key. This song may be playing while dancing."
