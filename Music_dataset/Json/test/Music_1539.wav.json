    "caption": "A male voice is singing along to a fast paced reggae instrumental. The drums are playing a reggae-groove along with a harmonica on the offbeat. Two e-guitars are playing a single note melody. Both are following the bassline adding harmonies. A saxophone is adding a little melody after every end of a phrase. The male voice is singing in the mid-range and sounds doubled. Some of the instruments are panned to the left and right side of the speakers. This song may be playing at a local bar."
