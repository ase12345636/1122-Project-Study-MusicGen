    "caption": "The Metal song features a manic drum roll followed by wide arpeggiated electric guitar melody in the beginning of the loop. When the beat drops, there is a flat male vocal singing over aggressive wide electric guitar chords, energetic bass guitar, energetic cymbals and punchy kick and snare hits. It sounds very energetic, like something you would go in a mosh pit for."
