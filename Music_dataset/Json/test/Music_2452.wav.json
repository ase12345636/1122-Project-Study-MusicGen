    "caption": "This is a latin pop music piece with a salsa beat. There is a male vocalist singing melodically in the lead. The melody is being played by an orchestra composed of the trumpet, the piano and the bass guitar. The rhythmic background is provided by a mild acoustic drum beat with heavy use of latin percussive elements. The piece has a sensual atmosphere. This music could go well in a Latin American soap opera soundtrack where there is a hopeless situation for one of the characters."
