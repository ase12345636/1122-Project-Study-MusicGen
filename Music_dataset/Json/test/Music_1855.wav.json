    "caption": "This is a folk rock/alternative music piece. There is a male vocalist singing melodically in the lead. The main tune is played by the acoustic guitar with a rather quiet bass line in the background. There is a timid acoustic drum beat in the rhythmic background. The atmosphere is sentimental and melancholic. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a drama TV series, especially during a scene where the episode would end with the characters daydreaming."
