    "caption": "The low quality recording features a cover of a rock song that consists of an electric guitar solo melody played over playback instrumental. The instrumental features a punchy kick and snare hits, soft cymbals and smooth bass. It sounds passionate, even though the recording is muffled and noisy, as it was probably recorded with a phone."
