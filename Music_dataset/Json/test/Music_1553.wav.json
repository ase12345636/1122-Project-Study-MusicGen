    "caption": "This is the amateur recording of a jazz music piece performed live on the street. The volume of the recording is quite low. There is a female vocalist singing upfront. The tuba is playing the bass line as an accompaniment to the vocals. The tuba player is playing a minimal acoustic drum kit made up of just a drum kick and a ride cymbal in the meantime. There is a swing feel to it. The quietness of the recording makes it sound like the music is coming from vinyl. It would suit perfectly as a piece in a movie playing on a vinyl record player."
