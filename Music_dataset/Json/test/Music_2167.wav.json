    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance sung by harmonizing mixed vocals and followed by acoustic rhythm guitar and shimmering shaker. In the second part, a hollow male vocal continues to sing over shaker and acoustic guitar. It sounds thin, but fun, happy and emotional - it was probably recorded with a phone or camera microphone."
