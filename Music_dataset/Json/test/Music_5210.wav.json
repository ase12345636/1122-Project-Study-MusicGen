    "caption": "The music features a female voice that sings in a theatrical style, similar to Broadway musicals. The bass guitar and drums blend together and play a light accompaniment. A piano can also be heard contributing to the overall accompaniment. A string section plays a long note melody that transitions into playing in unison with the singer's melody."
