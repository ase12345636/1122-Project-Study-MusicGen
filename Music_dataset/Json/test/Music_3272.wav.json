    "caption": "This low quality recording features an electropop song. At the beginning, there is a shooting sound. This is followed by cartoon voices. A fast paced vocal chop sequence is used for the main voice. Toward the end, another quirky voice joins in with another vocal chop sequence. This is accompanied by programmed percussion playing an electropop beat. A synth plays a repetitive lick. The bass follows the root notes of the chords. This song can be played at a club."
