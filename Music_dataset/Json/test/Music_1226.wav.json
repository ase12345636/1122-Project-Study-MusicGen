    "caption": "This is a Christian gospel music piece. There is a male vocalist singing melodically and in an emotion-filled manner. The keyboard is playing the melody with a harp sound while the rhythmic background consists of a simple acoustic sounding drum beat that is only played on the hi-hats. The atmosphere is spiritual. This piece could be playing in the background at a Christian religious event."
