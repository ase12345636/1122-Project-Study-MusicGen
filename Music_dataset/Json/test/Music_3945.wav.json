    "caption": "This is a trap piece. There is a male vocal rapping at the forefront accompanied by a repeating hollering vocal sample. A high-pitch synth is playing an ominous melody. There is a strong bass and an electronic drum beat with cicada hiatus at the rhythmic background. The atmosphere of the song is aggressive. The piece can be used in the soundtracks of crime movies/TV series that take place in the big city."
