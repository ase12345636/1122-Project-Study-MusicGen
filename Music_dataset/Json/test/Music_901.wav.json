    "caption": "This audio contains reggae-like drums playing along with a bass. An e-guitar is strumming short chords on the backbeat giving this song its typical reggae feel. An organ is playing a melody panned to the left side of the speakers playing short fast chords. A male voice is singing a melody in a higher pitch than a piano is walking down the scale creating a melody then a chime comes in getting the song ready for the next part. This song may be playing while sitting by a lake with your friends."
