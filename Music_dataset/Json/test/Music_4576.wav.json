    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a rock song and it consists of passionate male vocal singing over energetic drums, funky bass guitar, electric guitar melody and solo brass melody. At the end of the loop, there is a short snippet of choir singing in harmony. Overall it sounds funky, energetic, soulful and passionate -  as a live performance should sound."
