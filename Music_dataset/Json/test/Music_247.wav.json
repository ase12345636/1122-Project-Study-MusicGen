    "caption": "This song starts with a glitter sound and the drums hitting a soft crash. Followed by piano chords and a higher pitched melody accompanied by a stringlike synthesizer sound repeating a simple melody. The drums sound repetitive and programmed accompanied by some bongos  and a bass giving the song a funky groove. There is a beeping sound that sounds like it's not part of the song. This song may be playing while stuck on the telephone-line."
