    "caption": "This is a rock music piece. The male vocalist is singing melodically in the Spanish language. The keyboard is playing the chords of the song while the electric guitar joins with the occasional fills. There is a relatively quiet bass guitar supporting them in the background. The acoustic drums provide a basic rock beat for the rhythm. It has an easygoing feeling. This piece could be used in a teenage drama taking place in a Spanish-speaking country."
