    "caption": "An acoustic piano is playing a ballad with a lot of chord changes and a male voice singing in the higher register. The whole song sounds slightly sad or sensitive. The audio-quality is very bad, it is not very clear to hear if there are other instruments playing in the background. Also is the recording full of big reverb as being played in a big hall. This song may be playing at a live concert."
