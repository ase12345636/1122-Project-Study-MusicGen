    "caption": "This song is used as a theme for a prank video. There is a keyboard and bass guitar providing the melodic background while a dissonant synth plays an on-the-nose comedic tune. There is a funky but simple electronic drum beat for the rhythmic background. Scratching sound effects and a laughing track were also used to emphasize the comedic element."
