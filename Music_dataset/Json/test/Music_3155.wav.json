    "caption": "The low quality recording features a dance hall rhythm Christmas song that consists of flat male vocals, alongside high pitched male vocals at the very beginning, singing over syncopated snare, plucked sitar melody, \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern and simple bass. It sounds fun and happy, like something kids would listen to."
