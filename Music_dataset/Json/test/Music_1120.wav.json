    "caption": "The low quality recording features water and some metallic sound effects, followed by a dynamic orchestra that consists of a mellow string section, simple plucked harp and mystical woodwinds playing in the background. In the first part of the loop, the sound is completely muffled. It sounds like something you would hear in old movies."
