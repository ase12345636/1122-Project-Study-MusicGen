    "caption": "A digital drum is playing a groove that motivates to dance with a kick on every beat along with a shaker. Male backing voices are singing a melody in harmony and adlips that are panned to the right side of the speakers. A piano is playing a simple repeating melody and a soft bass sound is rounding the recording up. On top of that a male voice is singing phrases. This song may be playing at home dancing."
