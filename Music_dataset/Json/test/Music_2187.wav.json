    "caption": "This is a country folk song with a generally positive, cheerful and joyful vibe to it. The singer is a man with an elderly voice that has a quality that sounds like a gurgle. His style of singing and the content of lyrics and melody are similar to hearing a story being told. There aren't really any rhyming lyrics - it's more like he is telling a story in song form. There are licks being played on an electric guitar, as well as certain motifs on the violin  in between particular phrases by the singer."
