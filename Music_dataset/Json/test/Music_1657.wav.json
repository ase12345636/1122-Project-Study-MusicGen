    "caption": "The low quality recording features a disco song that consists a fruity male vocal singing over groovy bass, punchy \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern, wide funky electric guitar chords, shimmering open hats, muffled punchy snare, shimmering bells melody, groovy bass, high pitched sustained strings melody and low toms. There is a short snippet of harmonizing vocals at the end of the loop. It sounds energetic and addictive."
