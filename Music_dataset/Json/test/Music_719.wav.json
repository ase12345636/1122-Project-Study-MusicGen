    "caption": "This is a pop/funk music piece. There is a male vocalist singing melodically in the lead. The main melody is being played by the keyboard while the bass guitar is playing a groovy bass line in the background. The rhythm consists of an electronic drum beat. The atmosphere is groovy. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a crime/comedy movie, especially during the scenes where a character is trying hard to appear as a villain."
