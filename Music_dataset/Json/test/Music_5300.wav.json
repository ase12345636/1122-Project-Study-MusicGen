    "caption": "The low quality recording features harmonizing mixed vocals singing over groovy bass, shimmering cymbals, soft snare hits, funky guitar melody and bright brass melody. The recording is very noisy, in mono, with some crackles in it and it sounds funky and addictive - thanks to those vocals. Sounds like something you would hear in clubs during the 60s and 70s."
