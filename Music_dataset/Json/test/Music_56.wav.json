    "caption": "The Electro Pop song features a flat female vocal, occasionally supported by wide background female doubling vocals, singing over quiet drums, groovy and boomy bass, arpeggiated synth melody and some sound effects of the airplane and the explosion. In the second part, the drums cut through the mix more, therefore they are more audible, while the new elements appear, including shimmering bells and simple hi hats. Sounds like a low quality recording, especially because of that first part of the loop."
