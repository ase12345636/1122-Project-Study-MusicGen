    "caption": "The low quality recording features an afrobeats song that consists flat male vocal, alongside wide harmonizing male vocals, rapping over sustained synth lead melody, short synth melody, groovy bass, soft kick hits, punchy snare, shimmering shakers and syncopated toms. The mix is bad, thus it sounds kind of unprofessional, but still energetic."
