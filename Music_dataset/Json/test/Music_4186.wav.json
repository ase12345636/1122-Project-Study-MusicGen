    "caption": "The low quality recording features a traditional song that consists of reverberant, fruity male vocal singing over wooden & percussive elements, sizzling triangle hits, sustained strings melody, plucked strings melody and breathy flute melody. It sounds soulful, passionate, emotional, calming and relaxing - like something you would hear in a small village in a foreign country, full of joy and innocence."
