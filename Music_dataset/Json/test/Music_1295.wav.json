    "caption": "The low quality recording features a chiptune remix of a pop song and it consists of high pitched female vocal singing over, groovy piano melody, smooth synth bass, claps, shimmering hi hats and punchy kick. At the very end of the loop, there is a snare roll. It sounds energetic, fun, happy and groovy."
