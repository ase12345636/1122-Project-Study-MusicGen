    "caption": "This is an experimental rock/indie rock music piece. The rhythmic background consists of a peculiar 6/8 acoustic drum beat that has shifted kick drum hits. There are sleigh bells accompanying the drums. The synth bass is playing a simple and repeated theme. The atmosphere is eerie. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a noir movie where a character is devising a plan to deal with conflict."
