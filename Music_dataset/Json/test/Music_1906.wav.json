    "caption": "This is a compilation of various flamenco recordings. The acoustic guitar is being played at first with the picado technique and then with the free stroke technique. There is a percussive backing track in each part. The music has an exotic feel to it. These separate parts could be used as an advertisement jingle or they could be sampled for use in beat-making."
