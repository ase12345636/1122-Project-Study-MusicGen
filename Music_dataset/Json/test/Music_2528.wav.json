    "caption": "This is a gear review jam video. There is a male voice describing the tone that he achieves from using an amp with the electric guitar. The said amp applies an echo effect to the electric guitar, making it sound more dreamy. The performer is playing a simple tune. This piece could be sampled for use in an advertisement jingle or in beat-making."
