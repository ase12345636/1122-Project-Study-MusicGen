    "caption": "This is a Gregorian chant performed at a Christian Orthodox church setting. There is a female vocalist singing in the lead while a choir is singing in a hum-like manner at low-to-medium pitch. The atmosphere is religious and the character of the song is solemn. This piece can be used in the background at Orthodox religious events. It could also be playing in tragedy/aftermath of battle scenes in historical drama movies or TV shows with a Balkan/Eastern European setting."
