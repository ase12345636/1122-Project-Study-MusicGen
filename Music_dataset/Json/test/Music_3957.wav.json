    "caption": "The low quality recording features a metal song that consists of wide aggressive electric guitar chords, distorted bass guitar, punchy snare and kick hits alongside some snare rolls, synth keys melody and energetic crash cymbals. There are some glass hits and metallic object sound effects. It sounds chaotic, distorted, aggressive and muddy, since the frequencies are clashing with each other."
