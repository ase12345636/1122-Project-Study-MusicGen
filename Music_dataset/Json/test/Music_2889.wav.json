    "caption": "The low quality recording features a drums solo at the very beginning of the loop, after which a pop song starts playing and it consists of a passionate female vocal singing over buzzy synth lead melody. The drums solo contains snare roll and shimmering cymbals. Overall it sounds exciting."
