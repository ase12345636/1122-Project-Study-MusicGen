    "caption": "This is an instrumental occult rock piece. There is an electric guitar playing a simple melody with a minimal bass guitar backing. The atmosphere of this piece is sinister and unsettling, it gives the impression of a Satanic ritual about to commence. The tempo is slow. This music piece could be included in the soundtrack of a ritualistic horror movie/TV series or a video game of the similar genres."
