    "caption": "This is a chamber music piece. It is performed by a quintet of the harp, the flute, the violin, the viola and the cello. There is a constant rising and falling pattern, resembling the feeling of a wave. The piece has a mysterious atmosphere to it. This music would fit perfectly in the soundtrack of an adventure movie during scenes of a journey where the characters are crossing the sea."
