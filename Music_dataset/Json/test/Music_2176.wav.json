    "caption": "This amateur recording features a rock song. A repetitive phrase is played on the guitar. The first bar consists of only the guitar sound. The bass and percussion start playing after one bar. The bass plays one note in groups of twos. The percussion plays a groovy rock beat. The hi-hat is played in a group of four strokes on the closed hi-hat followed by one stroke on the open hi-hat. There are no voices in this song. The mood of this song is melancholic."
