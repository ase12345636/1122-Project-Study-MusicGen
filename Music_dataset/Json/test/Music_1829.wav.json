    "caption": "The song features a steelpan that creates the main melody. The sounds are bright and have a positive atmosphere. The track fits the afrobeat genre. In the background there are drums that play a mix between hip-hop and afrobeat patterns. A percussion synth creates a counter melody that contrasts the whole instrumental. This is a song you would play at a beach party in the caribbean at night."
