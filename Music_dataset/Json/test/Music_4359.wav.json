    "caption": "The low quality recording features a children's song that consists of organ keys chords, groovy piano chords, light snare hits, soft kick hits, shimmering hi hats, and flute melody. There are some squeaky sound effects, alongside plastic foley effects and outdoor ambience sounds. It sounds fun and happy, like something kids would listen to."
