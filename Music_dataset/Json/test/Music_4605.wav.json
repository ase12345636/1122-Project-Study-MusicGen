    "caption": "This is a live recording of a musician playing a Chinese flute, otherwise known as a dizi. It is a calming and melodic piece - and you could imagine yourself walking peacefully through marshlands or grasslands. Though the melody is enchanting, the audio quality is average - with a slight fuzzy buzz present in the background."
