A e-guitar strumming chords, piano, organ saxophones and trumpets are playing a short melody on the backbeat giving this song its reggae feeling. In-between the instruments are playing a short loud melody to break into the next part. The instruments are spread across the sides of the speakers. This audio may be playing in an urban coffee shop."
