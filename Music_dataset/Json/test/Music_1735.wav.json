    "caption": "This is a rock music piece with a leading male vocal. The electric guitar is playing the main melody while a simple rock beat is being played by the acoustic drums as the rhythmic background. It has the definitive qualities of 70s American rock music. It could be used in a movie taking place in the 70s. It could also be played at a rock bar or a sports bar in the background."
