    "caption": "This is a Christian gospel music piece. The male vocalist is singing melodically in the Spanish language. There is an acoustic guitar playing the main melody while a bass guitar plays in the background. In the rhythmic background, the acoustic drums are playing a calm beat. The atmosphere is religious. This music would suit well in Christian religious events in Spanish speaking countries."
