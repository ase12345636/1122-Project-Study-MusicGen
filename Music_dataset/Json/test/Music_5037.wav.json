    "caption": "This is an amateur cover of a guitar solo in a heavy metal piece. The solo is being played on an electric guitar. There is a rapid procession of high-pitch notes in the solo. The feel is complex and aggressive. The quality of the recording is a bit poor. If the quality issue can be resolved, this piece could be sampled for use in beat-making."
