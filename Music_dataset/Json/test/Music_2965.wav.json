    "caption": "This is a live classical music performance. The piece is being performed by a brass orchestra. There is a trombone playing the lead melody while other trombones and a tuba play the bass backing. The atmosphere is epic. This piece could be playing in the soundtrack of a historical drama movie during the scenes of an army marching towards the enemy territory."
