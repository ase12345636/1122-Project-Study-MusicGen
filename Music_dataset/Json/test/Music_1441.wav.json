    "caption": "The Rock song features wide harmonizing male vocals singing over wide electric guitar chord progression, punchy snare and kick hits, shimmering cymbals and groovy bass. At the very beginning of the loop there is a flat male vocal singing over echoing electric guitar melody and less energetic drums, after which the previously mentioned chorus starts. It sounds energetic and uplifting."
