    "caption": "This song has a typical reggaeton drumbeat that just sounds a little softer and not so much in the foreground. A synthetic bass is supporting the drums with a simple bassline. A processed guitar-like sound is panned to the left side of the speakers. Some gameboy coinlike sound is popping up here and there. A male voice is rapping while getting backing voices from another male voice. This song may be playing at a latin barber shop."
