    "caption": "This is an instrumental hip-hop music piece. It is meant to be used as a rap beat. There is a fuzzy synth bass playing a groovy bass line with a mellow sounding keyboard playing alongside it. There is a loud electronic drum beat in the rhythmic background. This piece has a crisp and urban atmosphere. It could either be used as a rap beat or it could take place in the soundtrack of a crime movie/TV show with a modern city setting."
