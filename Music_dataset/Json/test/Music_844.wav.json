    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a rock song that consists of an energetic female vocal singing over electric guitar chords, punchy snare and kick hits and distorted bass guitar. The recording is very noisy and buzzy, in mono, muffled and messy, as it was probably recorded with a phone. It still sounds energetic."
