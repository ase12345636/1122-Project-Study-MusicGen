    "caption": "This is a pop punk music piece. The male vocals are singing melodically. Initially, there is a clean sounding electric guitar playing the main melody. Then, a rising pattern starts to play and the distorted electric guitar takes the place of the clean electric guitar. The bass guitar is playing in the background. The rhythm is provided by an upbeat acoustic drum beat. The atmosphere is hard-hitting. This piece can be used in the soundtrack of a teenage drama as the opening theme."
