    "caption": "This is a tongue-in-cheek version of a reggae song edited to make it sound like a movie character was featured in it. It has a male vocal that starts singing with a Jamaican accent that turns into gibberish. Clean electric guitar and bass guitar provide the melodic background while the acoustic drums and percussion play a basic reggae beat for the rhythmic background."
