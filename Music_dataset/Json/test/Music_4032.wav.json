    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a regional Mexican song that consists of reverberant, high register, passionate male vocal singing over acoustic rhythm guitar and widely spread, groovy claps. It sounds passionate, traditional and emotional. Judging by the reverb, it was probably played in some huge concert hall."
