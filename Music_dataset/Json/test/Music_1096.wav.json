    "caption": "This is a modern sounding Afrobeat music piece. There is a male vocal singing the same line repeatedly vocal with a male back vocal ad-libbing in the background. The electric guitar is playing a mellow tune. A low-to-medium range bass line that can be heard. The rhythm consists of an acoustic drum beat with supporting percussive elements. Brass stabs can be heard every now and then. The atmosphere is groovy. This piece could be played at African nightclubs or dance clubs."
