    "caption": "This music is an instrumental with medium tempo. Four different tracks that are completely unrelated are being played one after another. It begins with an intense violin symphony, followed by a beep and a dead phone tone, and some synthesised articulation with bass synth. The music is dissonant, chaotic, confusing and random."
