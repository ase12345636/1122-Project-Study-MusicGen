    "caption": "This is a drumstep piece which is a mixture of the genres drum & bass and dubstep. There is a fuzzy and aggressive synth bass sound playing the melody with the use of a vocoder. An electronic drum with a sound similar to a 909 kit is playing a simple beat in the rhythmic background. The song is mid tempo, but it still has a danceable aura. It could be used in sportswear advertisements or could be playing in the background of a nightclub."
