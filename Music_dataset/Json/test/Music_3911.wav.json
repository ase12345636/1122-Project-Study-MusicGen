    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a folk song and it consists of acoustic guitar solo melody, followed by banjo melody. The recording is noisy, there are some natural sounds - since it was performed outdoors and the stereo image is unbalanced due to the fact that the instruments are leaning towards the right channel of the stereo image. It still sounds passionate and upbeat."
