    "caption": "This is a lullaby version of a pop music piece. The main tune is played by a lyre which creates a medieval aura in the song. There is also a xylophone playing in the background with a supporting tune. A cello can be heard playing staccato notes for the bassline. An occasional bell percussion that sounds similar to a sleigh bell can be heard in the background. This could both be played in wholesome social media content and also due to its soothing nature in playlists meant to be played at bedtime for babies."
