    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of traditional music and it consists of harmonizing female vocals singing over shimmering hi hats and tambourine hits, fat snare, boomy kick, groovy bass and short strings melody. The stereo image is unbalanced as the vocals are leaning towards the right channel of the stereo image. It sounds soulful and happy."
