    "caption": "This is a cumbia piece. There is a female vocal singing seductively joined by male back vocals singing in the chorus. The trumpet is playing the main melody joined by the piano and the bass guitar in the background. Latin percussion playing a cumbia beat provides the rhythmic background. The atmosphere of the piece is very playful. The ideal setting for this piece can be a latin dance course."
