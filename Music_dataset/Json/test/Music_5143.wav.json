    "caption": "This children's song features a male voice singing the main melody. This is accompanied by male and female voices singing backing vocals in harmony. This has a call and response technique where the main voice sings a line followed by the response by the choir. This is accompanied by percussion playing a simple beat. After two bars, the instruments pause. The bass plays the root notes of the chords and sliding to a pause at the end of the bar. During the pause, the voices continue to sing. The main voice sings two lines and the choir sings the third line with the main voice in harmony. The mood of this song is happy. After the pause, the singers return to singing the same melody. This song can be played in an educational movie for children."
