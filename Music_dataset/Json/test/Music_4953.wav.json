    "caption": "This techno song starts off with a synth playing a melody followed by another synth playing a burst of two chords. The two chord bursts are accompanied by percussion playing an outro roll. The instruments pause and a male voice starts to narrate a few lines. After two lines, the pitch of the voice is lowered in pitch to reach a bass pitch. This voice fades away to silence. This song can be played in a movie featuring a robot."
