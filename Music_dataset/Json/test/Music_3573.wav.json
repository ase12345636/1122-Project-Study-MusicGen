    "caption": "The low quality recording features a dubstep song that consists of buzzy, manic synth bass, punchy kick, slapping claps and high pitched laser riser. At the end of the loop, there is a short snippet of a much calmer section that consists of mellow claps, stuttering hi hats and arpeggiated dark piano melody. Overall it sounds aggressive and energetic."
