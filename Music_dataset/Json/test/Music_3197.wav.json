    "caption": "This amateur recording features a rock song. The main melody is played on violins. This is accompanied by percussion playing with breaks matching the breaks in the violin parts. At the end, the violins play a sustained note and a banjo starts to play a melody. A tambourine is played on the first count of the second bar after the banjo starts to play. This is an uptempo song and has a happy feel. This instrumental song can be played in a coffee shop."
