    "caption": "This is an instrumental jazz music piece. The main theme is being played on a theremin while there is a keyboard and an upright bass in the melodic background. For the rhythm, there is an acoustic swing jazz drum beat. There is an avant-garde feel to this piece. It could be used in the soundtrack of a sci-fi movie or a TV show. It could also be played in the soundtracks of video games with an outer space setting."
