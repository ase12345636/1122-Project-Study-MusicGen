    "caption": "The rock song features a fruity male vocal with occasional echoing effects, singing over punchy kick and snare hits, energetic cymbals, wide electric guitar melody and distorted bass guitar. Towards the end of the loop, there is a stuttering effect, which makes a perfect variation for such an energetic and aggressive song. It also sounds addictive, due to that cadence."
