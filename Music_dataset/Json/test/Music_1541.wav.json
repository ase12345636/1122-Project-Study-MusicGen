    "caption": "The Rock song features a flat male vocal singing over a wide electric guitar melody, shimmering hi hats, energetic crash cymbals, punchy snare and kick hits, groovy bass guitar and piano chord progression. At the end of the loop, there is a short tom roll, representing a transition to the next section. It sounds energetic - like something you would hear on a radio."
