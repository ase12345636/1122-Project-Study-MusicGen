    "caption": "This is an amateur recording of a vocal cover. There is a male vocalist singing out-of-tune over a pop music piece playing in the background while driving a car. In the backing track there is a female vocal. A strong bass could be heard. There are also strings barely audible from the poor acoustics of the setting. Overall, it is a recording of poor quality."
