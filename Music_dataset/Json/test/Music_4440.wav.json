    "caption": "This is a glam metal/heavy metal ballad. There is a male vocal and male back vocals singing melodically. The melody is being played on an electric guitar with a chorus effect applied alongside a bass guitar. The rhythmic background consists of a rock acoustic drum beat.The atmosphere is both hard-hitting and sentimental at the same time. This piece could be playing in the background of a rock/metal bar. It could also be included in the soundtrack of an 80s themed romance movie."
