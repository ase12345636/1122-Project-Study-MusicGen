    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of the percussive & arpeggiated acoustic guitar melody. There are some crowd chattering noises in the background, by which we can definitely conclude that it is, in fact, a live performance. Sounds a bit boomy and the high frequencies of the guitar are lacking volume."
