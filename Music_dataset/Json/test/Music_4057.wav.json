    "caption": "This is a kids music piece. There is a keyboard playing the main tune while the wind chimes and the xylophone can be heard adding texture. There are sound effects such as clicks and a clown horn. A female voice says \"ice cream\". The atmosphere is goofy and generic. This piece could be used in the background of an educational video about ice cream meant for kids."
