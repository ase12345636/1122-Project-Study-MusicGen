    "caption": "This recording contains male voice samples that seem to be pitched down and strongly processed with effects, also reverb and delay. One is panned to the right side of the speakers. A lot of white noise is running through a filter and an LFO. A synthesizer is playing a simple melody for a moment before fading away. This song may be playing in-between two songs of a DJ-set."
