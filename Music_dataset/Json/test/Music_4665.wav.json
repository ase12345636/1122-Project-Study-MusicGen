The tempo is fast and high spirited with animated trumpets, enthusiastic, syncopated piano accompaniment, energetic congas and bongos beats, spirited drumming, tambourine beats and vocal backup. The music is loud, bustling, hyper, high-energy and a little bit syncopated. It is fun, cheerful, celebratory and happy."
