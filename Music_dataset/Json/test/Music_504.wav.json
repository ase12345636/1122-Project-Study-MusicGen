    "caption": "This song contains a synth melody that sounds a little in the background slowly coming more into focus. This sound is full of reverb. Other synth sounds are playing pads and experimental pluck sounds. A glass sound is being played as a hi hat and a noise snare sound takes a lot of space with sounds panned to the left and right side of the speakers. This song may be playing in a club."
