    "caption": "The low quality recording features a pop song that consists of passionate male vocal singing over punchy \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern, groovy accordion melody, wide tinny hi hats, claps and groovy bass. In the second half of the loop, the instrumental consists of claps, \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern without the bass, soft crash cymbal, addictive synth melody and wide chicken clucking sound effect. There is a sweep riser at the very end of the loop. It sounds fun and happy, like something kids would listen to."
