    "caption": "This song contains a tabla rhythm spread across both sides of the speakers. An acoustic guitar melody panned to the right side of the speakers. Far in the background you can hear clapping as part of the song. A male voice is singing in a higher register than a violin takes over playing a melody in a higher register with reverb and a little delay. This song may be playing in a lovely movie-scene."
