    "caption": "The low quality recording features a tropical song playing over speaker and it consists of jazzy drums, muddy bass and exotic marimba melody. It is mono and noisy, while there are also some crowd mumbling and water splashing noises in the background. It sounds thin and loud, but tropical and exotic - like something you would listen to on a vacation."
