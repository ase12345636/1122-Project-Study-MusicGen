    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of an urban latin song that consists of flat male vocal singing over groovy piano melody, groovy bass guitar, wooden percussive elements, wide toms, warm brass melody and widely spread claps. There is a short, exciting background male vocal in the middle of the loop. It sounds exotic, groovy and passionate."
