    "caption": "This is the live performance of a reggae piece. There is a male vocal hollering while a younger sounding male vocal is singing in a Jamaican accent. An electric guitar is strumming chords in staccato while a bass guitar is playing a groovy bass line. In the rhythmic background, there is an acoustic drum playing a reggae beat. The atmosphere is chill. This piece could be played at beach parties and in the soundtracks of summer vacation-themed movies or TV shows."
