    "caption": "This song contains digital drums playing a four on the floor groove with a kick on every beat. A low synth arpeggio is serving as bassline rather than pitching up one octave while synth pluck instruments are playing a fast and repeating melody. A male voice is singing a melody in a higher key. The voice is panned to the right side of the speakers and is not the loudest element in the mix. You can hear a high pitch string drone. This song may be playing at a private houseparty."
