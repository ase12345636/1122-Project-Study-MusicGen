    "caption": "This is the live performance of a jazz music piece. There is an organ playing the chords in the background. There is a complex and improvised saxophone solo in the lead. The acoustic drums are playing a mellow jazz beat. The atmosphere is rather tranquil. This piece could be playing in the background at a coffee shop or a classy restaurant."
