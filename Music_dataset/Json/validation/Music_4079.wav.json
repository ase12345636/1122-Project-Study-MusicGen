    "caption": "This song features a slider didgeridoo being played. It starts off with the didgeridoo playing a note and then siding to a higher pitch. The sound of a water splash is played just before the slide. Then a hissing sound is heard followed by the didgeridoo being played once again without the vibration of the lips. This produces a hollow sound. This sound is produced in a foley studio."
