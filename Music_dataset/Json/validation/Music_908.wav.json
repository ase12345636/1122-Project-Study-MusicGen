    "caption": "This is a live acoustic performance of a folk rock music piece. There are male vocals singing melodically in the lead. The melody consists of a wide range of elements such as the acoustic guitar, the bass guitar, the piano and the saxophone. The acoustic drums are being played with brushes in the rhythmic background. The atmosphere is easygoing and joyful. This piece could be playing in the soundtrack of a feelgood movie during a road trip scene."
