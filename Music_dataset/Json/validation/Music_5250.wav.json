    "caption": "This seems to be a life recording because you can hear people in the background cheering. An electric bass is playing a bluesy bassline along with the drums holding a simple steady groove. One guitar is panned to the right side of the speakers playing chords while another e-guitar is playing a melody on the left side of the speakers. Both are fairly in the background. A male mid ranged voice is singing with a little reverb on his voice. This song may be playing life at a festival."
