The electric piano is playing the main melody while the electric guitar and the bass guitar are playing in the background. The rhythm is provided by a simple and upbeat acoustic drum beat. The atmosphere is festive and cheerful. This piece could be the opening theme of a Christmas movie that takes place in the southern Philippines."
