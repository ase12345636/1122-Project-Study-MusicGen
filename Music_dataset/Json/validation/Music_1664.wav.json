    "caption": "This is a metalcore/post-hardcore music piece. There is a male vocal singing using the vocal fry technique. A distant piano melody can be heard. There is an electronic drum beat with a heavy reverb effect. Later on, a string sound starts playing and adds texture to the melodic background. The atmosphere is dramatic and rebellious. This piece can be used in the soundtrack of a teenage drama movie, especially where one of the characters is experiencing a breaking point."
