    "caption": "The Alternative/Indie song features an intimate, widely spread, mixed vocals singing over noisy snare, punchy kick, wide tinny hi hats, electric guitar melody, synth lead melody and groovy bass guitar. At the end of the loop there is a short snare roll and some claps. It sounds easygoing and melancholic thanks to those vocals."
