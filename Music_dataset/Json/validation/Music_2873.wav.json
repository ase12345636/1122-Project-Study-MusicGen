    "caption": "The recording is full of natural sounds. Birds chirping, a river running and wind shaking the leaves. Then a percussive mid range instrument comes in with a steady repetitive rhythm. This instrument seems to be recorded in another environment than the natural sounds. The sound quality is different. This is not a professional recording. This song may be playing for a documentary."
