    "caption": "The heavy metal music features a guttural male voice. The sound is aggressive and energetic. The background has a dark tonality that contrasts the heavily distorted guitars that strum chords. An aggressive drum kit plays a common heavy metal beat in the background. This is a song you could hear at a monster truck show."
