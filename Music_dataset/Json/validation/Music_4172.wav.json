    "caption": "This is a world music piece in the style of Celtic folk music. There is a female vocalist singing gently and melodically. There is an airy strings section creating a relaxing atmosphere while the piano plays a mellow arpeggio. The atmosphere is soothing. This piece could be used during the vivid scenery shots of a movie that takes place in the middle of nature."
