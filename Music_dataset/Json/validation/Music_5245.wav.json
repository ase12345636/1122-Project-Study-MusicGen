    "caption": "This is the live recording of a heavy metal music piece. The male vocalist in the lead has a powerful wide-ranged vocal. There is an overdriven electric guitar that is playing a repeated riff with a bass guitar supporting it in the background. The rhythm is provided by a loud, fast-paced metal beat on the acoustic drums. The atmosphere is hard-hitting and energetic. The piece could be playing in the background of a rock/metal bar."
