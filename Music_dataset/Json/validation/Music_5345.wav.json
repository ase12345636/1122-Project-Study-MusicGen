    "caption": "A flute is playing a loud melody in the higher register while someone is playing a rhythm on a tabla. Percussive tambourinelike instruments serve as percussive addition along with some single bell or chime hits. This is an amateur recording and it sounds like it was recorded in a big room due to a lot of reverb. This song may be played at a live concert with people sitting in chairs being comfortable."
