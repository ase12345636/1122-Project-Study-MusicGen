The tempo is slow with a melodious electric guitar lead, soft acoustic guitar accompaniment and subtle bass complimenting the soft vocals and backup. The song is mellow, melancholic, pensive, insightful, euphonious, dulcet and soothing. There is a sound of static in the background. This song is classic Rock."
