    "caption": "This is a traditional Latin American song which would be suitable for salsa dancing. There are layers of percussion including bongo drums and snare drums. The pianist plays intricate melodies and the brass section plays vibrant and punchy motifs. It's a live performance with a relatively poor audio quality. There is a male group of singers performing energetically."
