    "caption": "The Curacao Waltz song features a flamenco guitar melody, electric bass guitar, acoustic guitar chords and shimmering shaker. Sounds very reverberant, as no instruments are clearly heard in the recording - except for the flamenco guitar. Overall, the recording is low quality, as the bad stereo microphone setup was used."
