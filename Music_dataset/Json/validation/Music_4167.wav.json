    "caption": "This song would be classified as bubblegum pop. The  music is more suitable for children, as it has a young and light-hearted style of production. There's a bright and tinny synth which is used to play a repeated motif, and at one point we hear a pair of birds mimicking the melody in their squeaky bird-like tones."
