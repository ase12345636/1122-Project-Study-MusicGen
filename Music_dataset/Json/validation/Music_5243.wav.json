    "caption": "This is a bluegrass music piece. Two male vocals are singing melodically in the lead. The tune is played by a rich chordophone background composed of the fiddle, the mandolin and the acoustic guitar. The atmosphere of the piece is joyful and nostalgic. It has a steady tempo. The piece could be used in the soundtrack of a movie or a TV series taking place in rural USA, especially in the scenes where there is some sense of yearning. It could be playing in the background at an American diner or a bar."
