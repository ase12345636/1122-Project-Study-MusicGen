    "caption": "The low quality recording features a filtered, throaty male vocal singing over mellow piano melody which can barely be heard due to clashing of frequencies. There are some crackling sounds occasionally. The recording is noisy and in mono, and it sounds vintage, nostalgic, euphoric, but also kind of creepy."
