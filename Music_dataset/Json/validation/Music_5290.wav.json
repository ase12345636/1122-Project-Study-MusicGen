    "caption": "The music excerpt sounds as if it was recorded with a low-quality phone and so the quality of the audio is also low. A repeating melody is being played by horns from an orchestra ensemble. Strings can be heard providing harmonic context. Wind sounds as well as electronic and video game sounds can be heard in the background. It sounds as if the atmosphere is tense and a fight is going on."
