    "caption": "This is an edited version of a pop music piece. The song is in minor key which gives it a melancholic aura. There is a male vocalist singing emotionally in a sigh-like manner accompanied with a piano tune and atmospheric strings in the background. However, due to the artificially added gain, the piece is too loud and the audio is distorted."
