    "caption": "This rock song features a guitar solo being played on a distortion guitar. This starts off with a string bend followed by a descending lick. A harmonic string scratch technique is played to produce a screeching sound. This is followed by a fast ascending scale run. This is accompanied by percussion playing a simple rock beat. The bass plays the root notes of the chords. There are no voices in this song. This is an instrumental. Due to the low audio quality, the instruments are not clearly heard."
