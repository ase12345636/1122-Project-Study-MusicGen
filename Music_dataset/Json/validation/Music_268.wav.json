    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance that consists of reverberant wooden percussion over an electro song, followed by crowd talking and public announcement vocals in the background. The song consists of groovy bass, haunting synth lead, soft \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern and shimmering shakers. It sounds like it was recorded somewhere outdoors, judging by the public announcement vocal and crowd noises."
