    "caption": "The low quality recording features a reggae song that consists of passionate male vocal singing over groovy bass, simple hi hats and punchy snare. There are some loud stuttering low frequency audio crackly noises in the recording, which makes it a bit uncomfortable to listen. It sounds groovy and chill regardless."
