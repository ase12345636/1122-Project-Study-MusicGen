    "caption": "The Pop song features harmonizing vocals singing over energetic crash cymbals, groovy bass guitar, wide electric guitar melody, punchy snare and soft kick hits. There is a short drum break at the very beginning of the loop. It sounds happy, nostalgic and euphoric, as it gives off vibes of a Christmas song."
