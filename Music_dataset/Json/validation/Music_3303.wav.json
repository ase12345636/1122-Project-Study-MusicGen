    "caption": "The orchestral music is purely instrumental and makes an exception only towards the ending of the music excerpt, where a male voice can be heard. Throughout this passage one can notice that segments of three different pieces are played one after the other, the 3rd one being the shortest - about 1 second in length. The first piece sounds like it depicts a dance, the second one an epic moment and the 3rd one is too short to draw any conclusions."
