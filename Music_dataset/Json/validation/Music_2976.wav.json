    "caption": "The low quality recording features a synth wave disco instrumental that consists of punchy \"4 on the floor\" kick patter, reverberant snare hits, shimmering hi hats, widely spread high pitched synth lead, groovy synth bass and repetitive percussive element. It is noisy, but also energetic and groovy- like something you would hear in a disco club."
