    "caption": "The low quality recording features a jazz song that consists of groovy double bass located in the right channel, groovy piano melody leaning towards the left channel of the stereo image and widely spread shimmering shakers and soft hi-hats. It sounds smooth, chill, easygoing and relaxing - like something you would hear in high-end restaurants."
