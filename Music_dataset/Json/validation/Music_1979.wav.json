There is a distorted electric guitar and a bass guitar playing the main tune while another distorted electric guitar is playing a medium-to-high pitch solo. The acoustic drums are playing a medium tempo heavy metal beat. It is a hard-hitting piece. This piece can be used in the soundtrack of an action-filled video game. It could also be playing in the background of a rock/metal bar."
