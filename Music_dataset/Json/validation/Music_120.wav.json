    "caption": "This is a Polish folk music piece meant to be played at weddings. This is an instrumental piece. The melody is played by a Polish fiddle, while there are occasional notes that can be heard from the background of an instrument that sounds like a mandolin. The rhythmic background is probably from the Polish percussive instrument baraban. There is a joyful atmosphere. This piece could be played at Polish weddings or it could be used in the soundtrack of a historical movie or a TV show that takes place in an Eastern European town."
