    "caption": "The low quality recording features a loud wind and water splashing sound effects, while there is a widely spread electric guitar melody and marimba, followed by smooth bass, soft kick, shimmering shakers and tambourine playing in the background. It is noisy and it sounds like it was recorded with the phone, while the music was added in post production."
