    "caption": "This song has an arpeggiated bassline that runs through a filter opening up. A drum groove that sounds acoustic is panned to the left side of the speaker with the snare being panned to the right. Atmospheric pad sounds, melodies are being played along with noise that reminds of wind. They are full of reverb and a ping pong panning effect. This song may be playing in a videogame completing a secret mission."
