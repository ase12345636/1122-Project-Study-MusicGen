    "caption": "This is a live recording of an instrumental electronic music beat. The rhythmic foundation of the beat consists of a simple medium tempo electronic drum beat. There are sounds coming from the background resembling a restaurant. It is a minimal-sounding groovy beat that is also danceable. With the removal of ambient sounds and a clean mix, this track could be used in the soundtrack of a TV show with an urban setting."
