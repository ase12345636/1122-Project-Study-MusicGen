    "caption": "This song contains drums with a deep and strong but jet soft kick sound with a snare that sounds muted. An upright bass or e-bass is playing a line along. A e-guitar is strumming a chord progression along with a piano. A male voice is singing in the midrange sounding sensitive and honest. Panned to both sides of the speakers two trumpets are playing a melody in the lower to mid-range. This song may be playing in a beautiful romantic art video."
