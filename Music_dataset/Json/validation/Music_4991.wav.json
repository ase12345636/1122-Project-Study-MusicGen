    "caption": "The low quality recording features a cover of a pop song and it consists of harmonizing male vocals and loud shoe tapping that serves as a rhythm. The recording is in mono and very noisy, as it was probably recorded with a phone. It sounds passionate and energetic - even without the instruments."
