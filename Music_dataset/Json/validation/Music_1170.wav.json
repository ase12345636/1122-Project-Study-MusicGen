    "caption": "The low quality recording features a rock song that consists of melancholic male vocal singing over a wide electric guitar melody, bouncy snare, groovy bass guitar and punchy kick. The recording is noisy, muddy and messy, since the frequencies are clashing with each other - drums cymbals are inaudible. Regardless, it sounds groovy, emotional and melancholic thanks to that vocal."
