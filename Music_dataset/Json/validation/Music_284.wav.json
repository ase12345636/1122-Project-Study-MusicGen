    "caption": "The Pop song features a flat female vocal, supported by wide harmonizing background vocals, singing over groovy acoustic rhythm guitar, offbeat shimmering open hats, claps, offbeat synth keys chords and a simple \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern that perfectly complements the groovy bass. Sounds energetic and uptempo, like something you would hear in clubs, or on a radio."
