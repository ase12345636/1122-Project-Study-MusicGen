    "caption": "This song contains a bass-melody repeating itself like an arpeggio. On top of that you can hear a digital string sound in the mid range playing a simple melody along with short female choir sequences that also sound digital. In the background you can hear explosions that do not belong to the song itself. This is an amateur recording and of poor audio-quality. This song may be playing in an arcade/action game."
