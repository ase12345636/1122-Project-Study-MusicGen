The steel guitar is playing a mellow tune while at the forefront while there is a backing composed of the acoustic guitar and the acoustic drums. There is a relaxing and psychedelic feel to the piece. This music could suit well in the soundtrack of a feelgood/comedy movie. It could also be playing in the background at a shopping mall."
