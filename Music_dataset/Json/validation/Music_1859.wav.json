    "caption": "This is a funk piece. It has an electronic drum beat with heavy use of claps in the rhythmic background. A synth with an organ sound is playing the melody, but it is filled with effects, so the sound is constantly changing. A fuzzy sounding bass is playing a funky groove in the background. There is an eccentric atmosphere. This piece could be used in the soundtracks of young-adult cartoons."
