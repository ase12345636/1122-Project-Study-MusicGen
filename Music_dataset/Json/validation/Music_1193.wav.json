    "caption": "This song is in very poor audio-quality and seems to lag. A big pulsating synthesizer pad is creating tension along with some more single holding note, higher register synth pad. A riser effect tells us that this part of the song is about to break into another part that will bring relief from the created tension. A synthesizer pluck is playing a catchy repeating melody. The male voice sings/raps in the higher register a male backing voice is shouting in the background. This song may be played on a dj mix in a club."
