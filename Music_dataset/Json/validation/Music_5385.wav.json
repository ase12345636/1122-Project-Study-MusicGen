    "caption": "This relaxing song features the sound of pads in the background. A guitar strums a chord first then plays arpeggiated chords. At the end of the song, a piano chord is played. A wave-like synth plays one continuous note in the background. The bass plays the root notes of the chords and the note lingers. The mood of this song is relaxing. This song can be played in a spa."
