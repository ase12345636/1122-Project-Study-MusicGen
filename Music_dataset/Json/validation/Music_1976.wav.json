    "caption": "This audio seems to contain two songs. In the beginning someone is strumming chords on acoustic drums while a male voice is singing in a high pitch. Then the song switches to a robotic voice sample singing. Then a digital drum comes in with a fat kick and bass sound creating the base together with the vocal sample. In the background you can hear scratching sounds. This song may be playing while working out."
