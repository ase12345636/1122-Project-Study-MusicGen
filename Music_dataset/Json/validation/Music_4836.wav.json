    "caption": "This is a live performance of classical music with clear tango influences. The piece is being performed by four different ranges of saxophone: alto, baritone, tenor and soprano. The variety of range using similar characteristics of sound gives the piece a vibrant atmosphere. This piece could be used in the soundtrack of a movie that is about a culture clash situation between North American and Latin American characters."
