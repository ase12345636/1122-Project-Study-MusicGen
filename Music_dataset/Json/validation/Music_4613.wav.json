    "caption": "The low quality recording features a big band song that consists of wide reverberant brass section melody, shimmering shakers and cymbals, bells melody, piano chord progression, smooth bass and soft kick hits. There are some tom rolls that represent a transition into the next section. It sounds happy and fun, but it also gives off euphoric and nostalgic vibes, as it sounds vintage."
