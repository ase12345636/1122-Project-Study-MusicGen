    "caption": "A digital drum is playing a techno groove with a half open hihat sound on the offbeat and a pregnant snare. A shaker and other little rhythmic elements are spicing up the drums. A simple digital bass is playing a melody while a very short voice sample comes in along with white noise rising. The elements are slightly panned across the speakers. This song may be playing in a techno club."
