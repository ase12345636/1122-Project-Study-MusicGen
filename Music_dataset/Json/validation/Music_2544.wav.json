    "caption": "This song contains a piano playing a minor chord progression. In the background you can hear a synth lead pad playing kind of an easy arpeggio melody. Panned to the right side of the speakers you can hear strings playing a melody in the midrange. A male voice is singing in the midrange breaking his voice into headvoice. This song may be playing on loud speakers when alone at home."
