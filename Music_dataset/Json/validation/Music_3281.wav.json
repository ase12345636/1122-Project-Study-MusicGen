    "caption": "The low quality recording features an electro song that contains distorted, repetitive female vocals over pulsating buzzy bass, wide percussive elements, shimmering cymbals, punchy \"4 on the floor\" kick pattern, claps and syncopated simple synth lead melody. It sounds hypnotic, mainly because of the repetitiveness - especially of the synth lead. It also sounds energetic, uptempo and distorted - like something you would hear in clubs during the 00s."
