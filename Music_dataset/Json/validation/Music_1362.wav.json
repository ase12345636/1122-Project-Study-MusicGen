    "caption": "This is the live performance of a Turkish folk music piece with arabesque influences. The clarinet is playing the main melody in the lead at a medium-to-high pitch. A secondary melody is playing the qanun in the background. There are supportive elements in the melodic background such as the saz, the keyboard and the bass guitar. The acoustic drums are playing a mellow beat accompanied by rich percussion. There is a vibrant atmosphere in this piece. This could be playing in the background of a Turkish cuisine restaurant or a hookah place. It could also be used in the soundtrack of a Turkish soap opera."
