    "caption": "The low quality recording features a compilation of rock songs in-between which there is a flat male vocal talking. At the very beginning there is a short snippet of a groovy piano melody and fruity male vocal singing over it. After that, there is an even shorter snippet of a song that consists of acoustic rhythm guitar and a male vocalist singing over it. And at the end of the loop, there is a fade in into a flat male vocal singing with background vocals over punchy kick, punchy snare, shimmering cymbals, distorted bass guitar and electric guitar melody. Overall it sounds weird and chaotic, due to the arrangement of the sounds, but it is also energetic."
