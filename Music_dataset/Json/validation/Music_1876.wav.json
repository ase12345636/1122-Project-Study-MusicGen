    "caption": "The low quality recording features a pop song that consists of mellow female vocals, followed by female background vocals, singing over punchy kicks, claps, shimmering open hats, stuttering hi hats, buzzy synth bass and wide synth pad chords. It sounds aggressive, bright, punchy, energetic and kind of manic due to those hi hats."
