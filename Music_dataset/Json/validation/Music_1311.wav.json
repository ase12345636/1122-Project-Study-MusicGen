    "caption": "This song has a repeating bassline that is accompanied by a highly distorted e-guitar playing along the low notes with the bass. The other strongly reverbed e-guitar is playing a long note melody against the beat of the drums that is playing loud and with a lot of open hihat. The male voice sounds loud and aggressive. He is screaming/singing in a higher pitched tone. This song may be played at a live rock festival."
