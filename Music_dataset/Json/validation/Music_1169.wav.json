    "caption": "This is an acoustic indie rock piece. There is a male vocalist singing gently in the Thai language. An acoustic guitar plays the main tune while a bass guitar is in the background. There is a piano that starts out by supporting the melody, but then wanders towards off-key notes, creating an air of conflict. The atmosphere is melancholic. This piece can be used in the soundtrack of a drama movie/TV show that takes place in Thailand."
