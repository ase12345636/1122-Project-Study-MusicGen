    "caption": "The Electro song features a repetitive male vocal singing over shimmering hi hats, tom rolls, wide claps, groovy kick, pulsating synth lead melody and groovy synth bass, which glues everything together. Even though the vocal is repetitive, it sounds very addictive and energetic in context."
