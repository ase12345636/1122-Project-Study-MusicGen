    "caption": "This is a Scottish folk music rendition of a rock music piece. It is an instrumental piece. The Scottish bagpipes are playing the melody while the rhythmic background is provided by a bodhran frame drum. The atmosphere is energetic and lively. The audio quality of the piece is quite poor. Still, it could be used in a comedy movie as a song playing from the radio."
