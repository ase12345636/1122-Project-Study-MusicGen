She is singing along to a backing track containing acoustic drums playing along with an e-bass. Castanets typical for latin music, an acoustic guitar, plucked and long notes being played by strings giving the song a feeling of flamenco music. In the background you can hear the crowd giving applause. This song may be playing as a live concert."
