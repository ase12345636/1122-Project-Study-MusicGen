    "caption": "This is a hip-hop piece. There is a male vocal rapping at the forefront while other male vocals can be heard singing ad-libs. A repeated theme is being played by a keyboard. A synth bass with low-to-mid characteristics can be heard playing in the background. The rhythmic background consists of a hard-hitting electronic drum beat. The atmosphere is groovy. This piece could be played at nightclubs. It would also suit well with a sports venue setting."
