    "caption": "The low quality recording features a live performance of a rock song that consists of flat male vocal singing over a wide electric guitar melody, groovy keys chords, located in the right channel of the stereo image, smooth bass guitar, shimmering open hats and hi hats and punchy kick and snare hits. It sounds groovy, funky and easygoing - like something you could lightly dance to."
