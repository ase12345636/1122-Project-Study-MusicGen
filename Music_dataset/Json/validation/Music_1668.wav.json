    "caption": "The drums are playing a four on the floor techno rhythm with hihats and a strong kick. A synthetic bass follows the kick with almost just a single note playing. Panned to the left and right side of the speakers you can hear a monotone, repeating synth melody. This song may be playing in a technoclub."
