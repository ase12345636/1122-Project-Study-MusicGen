    "caption": "A rock backing track is being played containing a e-bass, acoustic drums and a clean e-guitar playing a melody on top. In the foreground you can hear sounds that do not belong to the song. Chainsaws slashing things, monster sounds and female voices screaming like being in a fight. This is an amateur recording. This song may be playing in a violent videogame."
