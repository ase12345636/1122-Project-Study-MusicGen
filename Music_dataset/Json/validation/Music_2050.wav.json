    "caption": "The low quality recording features a Northern Soul song that consists of passionate female vocal singing over groovy piano chords, groovy bass, shimmering tambourine layered with punchy snare hits, muddy kick hits and groovy church organ melody. It sounds thin, but also easygoing, nostalgic, sentimental and passionate - like something you would hear in clubs during 60s and 70s."
