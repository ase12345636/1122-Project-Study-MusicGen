    "caption": "This goth metal song features a male voice singing the main melody. The voice is deep. Toward the end, there are other male voices singing vocables. This is accompanied by heavy percussion using a five-beat common time pattern played on floor toms with a shuffle note each note creating a triplet feel. The distortion guitars play heavy descending chord riffs using palm muting technique. The bass guitar plays the root notes of the chords. At the background, there is an high pitched sound played on a synth that gives this song an eerie feel. This song can be played at the end credits of a horror movie."
