    "caption": "Instrumental Chicago blues music featuring a saxophone melody interspersed with licks from harmonica, Hammond style organ, acoustic piano and electric guitar. The drums play a shuffled backbeat on the snare and low toms under a repetitive electric bass riff. Would be at home in a roadhouse or barbecue festival."
