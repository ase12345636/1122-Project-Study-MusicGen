    "caption": "This pop song features a male voice singing the main melody using vocables. This is accompanied by an acoustic guitar strumming chords. The piano fills at a higher register and also plays chords. The bass guitar plays the root notes of the chords without any flourishes. A shaker is used in the background which acts as the percussion. Hand claps are played at every alternate count. Bells are played on the first count of the first two bars of each phrase. The melody is happy and upbeat. This song can be played in a movie scene featuring a family on a road trip."
