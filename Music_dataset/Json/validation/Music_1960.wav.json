    "caption": "A male voice is talking in a typical advertisement manner. In the background you can hear a song containing a strummed acoustic guitar, a melody played with a xylophone and whistling in the same melody. An e-bass is underlining the song with a walking bassline. A kid's voice talks for a moment then the song stops as it comes to its end. This song may be playing in a happy advertisement."
